Here I am, eleven-twenty-seven,
doodling on some note paper, still
putting  you out of my mind.

Three minutes later, still the same
thing  is going on. Afraid to write
what I know should be said.

What's  on my mind, in my head,
it's all the same thing.
But I can't even  put it on paper,
the pencil won't say what I want.

My heart  knows what it thinks
it wants, but it never learned
to move the  tongue the right way.
