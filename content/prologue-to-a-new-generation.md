Somewhere in a dream, a woman cries out, looking for what is
real. And in her dream she sees a man, his hand resting gently
on her shoulder, words come out of his mouth, but she can only
hear his thoughts: <q>Wake up to real life, don't leave me here
breathless waiting for your eyes to open.</q> But she looks away
into another world.

Somewhere in a dream, a woman cries out, she can't find the end
of the darkened tunnel, there's a light at the end is all she
knows. But a man stands beside her, his words she can hear:
<q>Wake up to real life, I'll hold my breath forever for you.</q>
But she can't reach his opened hand, so she looks into another
world.

Somewhere in a dream, a woman is looking for a door to lead to
another world, a world apart from this dark and empty tunnel. She
carries her burdens with her and they drag her deeper into the
solitude, but there is a man lifting with all his might to free her.

But she can only barely see the outline of the man who, in her
despairing imagination, has come to rescue and free her. And
she fights her inner demons as they caress her with their lonely
words, begging for her just to give up and let it all collapse.

Her fears are all around her, her pleasures also call her name,
so she looks away from the man who stands beside her. And as she
looks away, she feels a great sadness, for she feels that she is
moving away from someone she should love, but she doesn't remember
his face. She can't recall a time when she felt as tired as this.

And there is a bed, and there is a pillow, and a blanket. Soft
cushions, covered in silk, invite her to lie down and sleep. But
the man softly grips her shoulders, speaking in a quiet voice: <q>Wake
up to this real world, to real life, return to me. I will wait
forever for you.</q>

The man stands quietly, seeing how she won't let go, and he holds
her hand closer still to his heart.

Some doctors walk by, pretending not to notice what takes place in
that hospital room for hours every day. A man stands by a woman's
bed, quietly speaking to her, begging her to awake: <q>Wake up to me,
to real life, I'll never let go. Wake up to me, wake up to me, I'll
wait forever for you.</q>
