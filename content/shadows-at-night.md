<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
&nbsp;A solemn silence, as of the
funeral mourners before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a long foreseen eulogy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;We all knew he would die.
But as the clock strikes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2am
my eyes are still awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chasing shadows in the night.
