Sometimes waiting is forever,
holding on to a fleeting promise
in one moment is beaten and blown away.
Every day a lifetime of memories
and hopes and dreams
not quite a handle to grab on to,
but maybe enough to fill me with desire
of something a little more tangible.
These minutes feel like lifetimes,
and this year looms ahead
an unending chasm.
But soon it is over and I'll emerge
again to survey my surroundings
perhaps a familiar marker
something set aside but remembered
and treasured.
