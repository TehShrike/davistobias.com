You and I had
good times. (That's us,  you and I)
There was depth to
our conversations, (no one can deny this)
and
none of  our faults (it's nothing personal)
would  separate us.
It seems like we hardly knew each other.
Every thing  you did,
every word you said,
it is burned in my mind.
Seared  by commitment
and our promise.
But you never promised me all of  yourself.
We both knew who
held our hearts strings.
And I  believe that covenant,
those truths we held on to.
But it is hard  to believe
when I can't see.
This moment of sorrow, when it is  hard to believe,
Right now:
This is where faith and life collide.
