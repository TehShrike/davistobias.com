These weeds and corruptions fill  
and no longer does the soil,  
riven with cracks from  
rain flowing as tears,  
hold good things. And yet,  
a grove of trees  
bearing fruit only a while  
is yet loved in the winter.  
Small hearts make small promises,  
but one is a seed  
from which grows a tree,  
but perhaps only with tenderness.  
Strong and supple, but not yet,  
for now is a seed only  
and a promise only.  
The soil is healed  
with seeds of grass,  
medicine stitching together  
what was deeply broken.  
Some day, sunlight  
creeps in slowly,  
darkness fades,  
and morning brings tears of joy.
