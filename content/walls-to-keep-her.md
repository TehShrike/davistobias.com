Every day she waits,  
that queen of a desolate kingdom.  
Desert filled with sand  
of a thousand years,  
no flower blooms there anymore.

Stone walls, built high,  
and years pass by  
turning walls into fields of sand,  
empty and forgotten.

As the sun sets on her desert  
she cannot remember the walls,  
but beyond them now  
is only emptiness.

Queen, high above the ground,  
she does not notice others  
because there is only one.  
Only one man is her rose,  
and that rose is a king.
