title: A Few Words on Modesty

categories: essay

I'm going to be blunt: this essay is for Christian men only.

If you aren't one of those, you can of course read this (it's the
internet, I can't stop you), but this isn't meant for you. I'm
going to skip a lot of details that might be helpful for non-men, or
for non-Christians.

---

Like most people, I spend an enormous (and probably unhealthy) amount
of time on the internet. I like to keep track of what's the latest
thing being talked about. See the trends. I want to be hip, I guess.

So I know the topic of modesty is talked about nearly to death, and
pretty much every time it's talked about a lot of people get annoyed,
and a lot of stupid things are said.

> People saying stupid things on the internet? Impossible!

Recently though, I read an article written by a man, who talked about
the problem not being cleavage, but about the heart.

So I thought I'd address some misconceptions about modesty that it
seems that men often have.

## Men are visual creatures

You've probably heard that phrase, like, a bajillion times.

I'm going to tell you something: it's not really true.

Well, it's true in one sense: us men enjoy visual things. In particular,
we like to look at beautiful women, and *that's not wrong*.

You probably already know this, but I'll say it anyway: Looking at and
appreciating beautiful things is not wrong, even if that beautiful thing
is a woman. What's wrong is when our minds go from thinking "that is so
beautiful" to lust.

So it's not really that men are visual, what's wrong is that the heart
of man is desperately wicked, and it's very easy to move from enjoying
beauty to lust.

> But why does that matter?

Lot's of people on the internet writing about modesty mean well, I'm
pretty sure, but there's an important point that is missed when they
repeat that phrase "men are visual creatures".

The point is this: you, as a man, don't need to automatically turn to
lust when you see something beautiful, or something sexual.

If you are struggling hardcore with pornography, you may find that
surprising, but it's totally true: when you see some woman who looks
real good, dressed in yoga pants, your mind doesn't have to get
carried away with lustful thoughts.

You don't have to sin.

But if all you read or hear is people telling you "men are visual
creatures", it can become difficult to see it any other way. You start
to tell yourself "well I can't help it, she was dressed in yoga pants!".

On the one hand I think, yeah, women should dress modestly, and I think
tight pants are probably a bit immodest.

But on the other hand, since I'm actually talking to Christian men,
Ireally have to level with you:

## That's a bullshit excuse for your lack of self control

And I should know, because I rolled around in the shit of pornography
for many years, and I totally used that as an excuse to explain to
myself why it was so easy to lust after another woman.

But here's the thing: remember this verse?

> If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it
> from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your
> members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast
> it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your
> members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
> (Matthew 5:29-30)

I'm actually not convinced Jesus was exaggerating on this one. Despite
all the pastors and stuff telling me that He was using hyperbole, I'm
not really so convinced.

But here's the thing: whether Jesus was using hyperbole or not, He
still seemed to take lust seriously. Biblical Law talks about getting
the death penalty for people who commit adultery, and Jesus is saying
basically this:

> You know how big of a deal adultery is, what with the death penalty
> and all? Well if you lust, you're commiting a sin that's just as bad.
> Like, it's a **really** big deal.

So if you think that a woman dressing immodestly is what's causing you
to lust, you only have a few options:

1. Cut out your eyeballs.
2. Move to somewhere where women don't exist.
3. Move to somewhere where women are not visible. Like somewhere in the
	middle east, where they wear burqas.

You can't take the lazy middle ground here. You either need to admit
that it's not immodest women that cause you to lust, or you need to
make it so you can't see immodest women.

You really don't have any other choice, because:

## Women are going to be immodest

Imagine if you could convince every Christian woman to dress modestly.

Imagine if all the Christian women ditch the yoga pants, and they dress
in burqas so now you don't give in to your visual senses.

Here's the bad news: there's still going to be a whole pile of women
who aren't Christian, and they are going to dress immodestly. Non-Christians
are not, in general, going to follow your Christian views of modesty,
even if you can prove them from the Bible.

So the problem is that you, a Christian man, need to learn to control
your sinful desires.

The problem isn't that women dress immodestly.

The problem is *you*. The problem is *your sinful heart*.

## For Christian men who struggle with pornography

If you, as a Christian man, struggle **at all** with pornography, you
need to step out of the discussions about what is modest. It's time for
you to man up, to look at your sinful heart, and face up to the fact that
you lack self control.

Do you struggle with pornography? Then you should **not** be discussing whether
yoga pants are modest or not. Stop reading those article. Repent of your
sinful lusts. The problem isn't that women wear immodest clothes, the problem
is that *you* have a heart that is inclined to sin. Your conscience is broken,
work on that.

## For Christian men who previously struggled with pornogrpahy

If you, as a Christian man who once struggled with pornography, ever find
yourself in a conversation *with other men* talking about how women should
dress modestly, stop the conversation.

The conversation shouldn't be about about modesty unless the men who are
present have dealth with their own sin of lust.

Be the "bigger man" and confess of your sin to the other men, and tell them
about how the sin of lust and pornography is so much bigger and more pressing
to men than whether women dress modestly.

Call them to repentance. Be a real man and offer your help to others. Maybe
you can help other men fight against the lust of the flesh.

## For all other Christian men

Suppose you find yourself in a discussion about modesty, and all of the men
present have conquered sexual temptation and lust. What then?

I'm not going to pretend to know what to say to daughters and wives to
help them dress modestly. But what I do know are two things:

### 1: The primary issue is with the heart

I mean, sure it's important to be able to help your daughter understand why
a low-cut shirt is not really modest. But you know what's more important? To
make sure that her heart is seeking to obey and honor God.

I've known more than one father who has spent all his energy trying to get
his daughter to dress modestly, but doesn't bother trying to pull her heart
to follow God. And I've known many fathers who have a daughter who rejects
the faith.

What is more important to you: that your daughter not wear those immodest
clothes, or that they have a heart that truly seeks God? If it's the second
thing, and you only seem to find yourself fighting on the first thing, you
should talk to your pastor or something and figure out how to point your
children to Christ and to His word.

### 2. Don't use excuses to motivate

If you find yourself in a discussion about modesty with women (daughters,
wives, or otherwise) and you find yourself saying "men are visual creatures"
(or something like that), you need to stop and repent.

The issue isn't that men are visual creatures, and women shouldn't walk
around afraid that their attire will cause other men to lust. It is not
the fault of the woman, even if she were to dress in incredibly immodest
attire. It is the fault of sinful man that they sin.

Your motivation in teaching modesty **must** be to honor God and obey
His word. You can say things like "you should practice compassion to
men who have a harder time resisting temptation", but you should never
imply that men are powerless to resist temptation.

## Finally

It's easy to get caught up in discussion about modesty, and about whether
things like "yoga pants" are modest or not, but let me remind you of a thing
Jesus said in Matthew 7:

> And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not
> consider the plank in your own eye? Or how can you say to your
> brother, "Let me remove the speck from your eye"; and look, a
> plank is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from
> your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck
> from your brother's eye.

In the discussion of modesty, it could be paraphrased this way:

> And why do you look at the immodesty of your Christian sister, but do not
> consider the sexual sins you struggle with? Or how can you say to your
> sister, "Let me help you with your sin of immodesty"; and look, you are
> looking at porn on your cellphone? Hypocrite! First deal with your own
> sin of sexual impurity, and then you will see clearly to help with the
> sin of immodesty.

If you are a Christian man, it's time to man up: confront the greater
sin of pornography before you even think about modesty.
