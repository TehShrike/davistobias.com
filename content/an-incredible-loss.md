title: An Incredible Loss

I will never forget.

The words are common now, almost enough to be a cliche, but they mark
a sentiment which runs deep in America.

The loss of the human lives wasn't the only thing that gripped at the
hearts of people worldwide, it was the suddenness and closeness of the
attack. Certainly the number of people inside the buildings was a large
part of the emotional response, but I think it was the incredulity that
such a thing could even occur.

Forever burned in the minds of every American who saw: The buildings
falling, the people jumping, the dust, the sweat. Heroes everywhere
helping the fallen, searching for the lost.

And then...

It was nothing sudden, a slow change over the years. A people overtaken
by a battle against an enemy with no name.

<q>Remember our troops.</q>

<q>God bless America.</q>

<q>Land of the free, because of the brave.</q>

Complex arguments simplified to fit on bumper stickers.

Lengthy thoughts on war and freedom and difficult subjects which have
filled many books, all of it discarded and set aside. Scholars who have
studied these ideas, warriors who have lived out these philosophies, all
their words and ideas were put aside and a loud clamor filled the air.

Pictures of war fill the television screens, and videos of war fill the
internet. Everyone voicing their opinions and thoughts, but no one looking
behind the curtain of ignorance.

People say <q>Never Forget</q> and point to the loss of life.

People say <q>Remember our troops</q> and point to this one event, September 11th.

Many years from now people will look back and remember September 11th, not
for the loss of lives, but for the response that followed. Confusion and
fear outweighed the desire for freedom from oppression and we passed laws
to let government creep into our daily lives.

We let the government listen to our phone calls so we could have a little
peace of mind. We accepted the personal searches at airports so we could
fly in safety. We let police search our homes without serious cause so we
could be assured our neighbors weren't going to kill us.

No law was passed and no significant change was made, but now, nine years
later, we accept government intrusion and control. Most people are even
ignorant of why this loss is a bad thing.

September 11th, 2001: I will never forget.

On that day I didn't see two towers fall, I saw my freedom and my liberty
finally collapse.
