If you can take a few minutes right now, just stop and think of this one person:

Search into your furthest memories and strain to see the image of that one who appeared to you in a dream, that someone whose face appeared to you but a minute and you knew in your heart...

<span style="font-style: italic;">"Who are you? ... What are you doing in my dream and capturing my heart?"</span>

She never answered me, that frail and ethereal vision, but in my heart I knew she was that person that completed me. Illusory? Perhaps. It is an abstruse phantom, but it plagues my heart to this day.

And then one day I look and see that face, that someone I knew from my dreams, she stood right in front of me once and I held her hand and said words of power and confession, and I saw that look in her eyes that I had seen many years before in memories far removed:

<span style="font-style: italic;">"In truth, I love you and it shall always be this way."</span>

And time went by, that face that I once saw retreated from my memory into the cold of amnesic indifference. And I told a lie I will never forget, but a few words could break the world around me so quickly, and I didn't understand why I would say those things.

<span style="font-style: italic;">"My love for you is only as to a sister."</span>

And so I made myself believe a lie, and in that lie was deliverance and absolution from the first lie. Life continued and still goes on, pressing unrelentingly forever forward, and I have forgotten how I could let this one person walk away.

How can I go on living, seeing this face which haunts me forever and tells me what I let go and what terrible lie I told.
