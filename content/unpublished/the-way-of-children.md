When I was a child, I acted as a child. I still do, actually. But as I grow older, I put away childish things.

Years ago I read a book that changed my thinking, and greatly shaped several years of my life. The book was a story about a man who meets a child, and the child changes the mans life. The child reminds the man of the innocence of youth, and how as adults we grow out of that innocence and become adults.

Become more jaded.

More cynical of life.

As we get older we realize that people don't always mean what they say, and even our friends will lie to us. We start to notice that there are a lot of people who don't care about us, and they'll deceive us to make a few more dollars, and they'll hurt us inside, where we thought we could be safe.

There comes a point in our lives that we realize there are things that can't be deflected by our pillow forts and can't be stopped by a blanket. Someone says something that hurts us so deep, and even the kisses of someone we love cannot drive away the pain and the sorrow, and that pain and sorrow we will have to carry alone for the rest of our lives.

When I was a child, I thought friends would never hurt their friends. When I was a child, my best friend told her friends that I was a nobody. That's when I first realized that people could hurt other people on purpose. That a person can say they are a friend, but still hurt you.

Many times people will say wistfully that they wish they could have the innocence of youth, that they could be free from the cares and worry of life. To be free of the hurry and bustle of life. To have the intense joy of something as simple as someone giving you an ice cream cone.

I hurt people deeply, and I continued doing it because the end result was enjoyable for me. I didn't understand that I could hurt someone so deeply, and affect their life so negatively, and even though I knew the thing that I did was wrong, I did it anyway. This is the way of a child.

In the innocence children, there is pain much deeper. Where there is no worry, there is no care for others. As a child, love is only selfishness.

The spring blossom of youth soon fades, but not to be jaded by the harshness of life. The innocence of youth is lost to the realization that we humans are cruel and mean. We hurt each other, and we usually do it on purpose. But it is not enough just to see that other people hurt you. This does not make you an adult.

Wanting to return to the innocence of childhood is to cause others pain. As children we were ignorant of the pain we caused others, and we were ignorant of how our actions would hurt people. But as we grow older, we put away the selfishness of childish things.
