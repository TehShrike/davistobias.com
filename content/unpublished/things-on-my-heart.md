There's a lot on my heart tonight: I've finally reached a point where I can see the end of school and I have a reasonably good job mostly lined up for when I'm done, so I've been thinking of how the next "stage of life" will be starting shortly. Here is what I've been thinking about mostly:

Some people say men are afraid of relationships, afraid of commitments. One lady told me that, but at the time I didn't realize that what I was afraid of was being vulnerable. It's not the decisiveness of a commitment that I was afraid of, it was the vulnerability that the commitment required.

When I was younger I quit my job because I wanted to know what it would be like to have all the time I wanted to finally read books. (I haven't always been a planner, as you can tell.) Another time I left a job that would have turned into me owning a restaurant, so I could volunteer for a couple years at some camp. Then when I left the camp, only a few years ago, I abandoned a solid career to go to school and try to get into an industry I knew nothing about.

I never wanted to make a serious commitment to a job or a place or even, sadly, to friends.

But over the past three or four years I have been having a change of heart. A change of focus. I guess that's part of "growing up", that now I am making plans for a hundred years from now. My carefree spirit has changed quite a bit. Now I have commitments.

I'm not complaining: I have been blessed with an opportunity that I would never have dreamed possible, and blessed with many good close friends. I guess I'm just getting impatient to be done with school so I can move onto what I can see waiting right in front of me.

Many years ago a friend told me what love is, but I forgot what was said--at the time it was very meaningful to me, but now I don't think it would satisfy.

These days I think love is more about being vulnerable to someone. Caring about someone enough to drop the veil that guards your face when you normally talk to people. Dropping the veil because it makes it harder to see the other person.

I guess what I really want is to be vulnerable again.
