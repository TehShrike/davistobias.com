title: Three groups, their relations and states

I'm going to discuss three groups of people, how they
interact with each other, and how they relate to gun
control: Government, Citizen, and Criminal.

The following diagram shows the three groups, and their
interactions with each other:

	1: Government
	2: Citizen
	3: Criminal
	    1
	   / \
	  A   B
	 /     \
	2---C---3

## A: Government/Citizen

Resistance to tyranny.

## B: Government/Criminal

Enforcement of the punitive legislation.

## C: Citizen/Criminal

Defense from lawless behavior.
