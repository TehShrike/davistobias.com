Dramatic lines of theological brilliance, but if they do not change the heart what is the purpose?

In reading Rushdoony's "Law and Liberty" I have come across the most clear argument for Christians to <span style="font-style: italic;">strongly</span> impact the legislation process. Essentially Rushdoony refutes the argument implied by the statement "Morality cannot be legislated." While this has some merit of truth, in that the law itself cannot make someone a better person, it is actually a lie.

Morality is always being legislated. If a law is passed making murder illegal, this is a moral law legislated. The law which prohibits theft is a moral decision of which there can be no escape. If you were to pass a law restricting Islamic law from being taught in schools, whether for Christian means or for secular anti-religion means, this would be a case of legislated morality. That is specifically, a moral law has been legislated.

The myth that humanism has propagated is that there are some laws which are entirely neutral, and do not stem from a sense of morality. Morality comes from religious beliefs, whether theistic atheistic or otherwise. In this sense humanism is a "shadow religion", that is, it is a religion which claims to <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be a religion. Humanisms morality does not come from God, but it comes from the invented god of self.

Why do you suppose that, in the Old Testament, the Israelites were always<span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">worshiping handmade idols</span></span>? It is because, when man has rejected the <span style="font-style: italic;">absolute truth</span>, man must make up some truth of it's own. Whether that be golden figurines, stone statues, specific people, or humans as a whole which are claimed to have power, the first step is <span style="font-style: italic;">rejection of God's law</span>.

Humanistic law (based on humanism strictly) is made to <span style="font-style: italic;">save</span> the people. This is why it promises that, if only they can pass the right laws or fund the right people, culture will be restored and poverty will be eliminated and there will be no more war. But we as Christians should know that <span style="font-style: italic;">the law cannot save</span>, and further that <span style="font-style: italic;">man's heart cannot be changed by law alone</span>. As Rushdoony points out, "we all slow down a bit when we see a patrol car on the highway", but it is not the <span style="font-style: italic;">heart</span> that is changed: The person goes back to speeding when the patrol car is gone.

The statement of "you cannot legislate morality" is an obfuscation of the more correct statement of "law will not change a persons heart". But that is not the scriptural reason for the law, instead, the laws purpose is as a <span style="font-style: italic;">restraint</span> to evil. By fining and jailing those who speed we restrain those who would drive recklessly at dangerous speeds. This is a concept which needs to be realized more by Christian and non-Christian alike: The law's purpose is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">restrain evil</span>.

I encourage everyone to read <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> by Rushdoony.
