A couple days ago I was borrowing my roommates video camera, a nice little thing, and I went to downtown, snuck up some parking tower to the top (fourth) floor and recorded some traffic. Then I went to the Old Market area to record "life", I got some good clips of people walking in crowds, some horse carriage shots, and some other stuff. Here's where the fun starts:

This kid walks up and immediately starts talking to me (I am going to try to get a written transcript or audio) about some random stuff, chairs, goth kids and whatnot. He has this big cloak on and is dressed all Renaissance style, and I am thinking to myself: This man is really strange, but I like strange people. So we talk about preppy dressed people, we talk about goth kids hanging out downtown, and then he mentions something about his soul being 78,000 years old. Yep. You got that right, seventy eight thousand years old.

Of course he says stuff about hypnosis, past life regressions, and so on. I thought this would be a fun conversation, so I recorded it, with his knowledge of course. So some of my favorite highlights were when he told me that he was now a vampire, he adapted so apparently he doesn't have to drink blood, but he wants to anyway. He knows the master/prince of Omaha who gave him his dirty thoughts, he also knows of the prince of St. Louis who "owns strip clubs and stuff" and plays role-playing games as a vampire.

Anyway, I will get those transcripts or audio on here real soon so you can all laugh with me.
