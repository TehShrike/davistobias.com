Fair warning: This should not come as a surprise, given the title, but this post will be discussing a topic that some may not find "suitable for children".

Our current culture is obsessed with the sexual.

This is not news, of course, I just want to draw out the point first.

Look at advertisements, look at popular online videos, look at theater films, ask the internet what a large chunk of it's traffic is used by (hint: pornography). Sex sells, is the catch phrase, and this topic has been the subject of many books, and quite a few songs. One of my faorite bands says "sex is currency, she sells cars, she sells magazines".

In fact, at the university I find that sex is such a popular topic that the school's opinion paper ran, at least for a while, a "sex column".

And in this larger discussion about sexuality, the concept of "freedom" is brought up, usually in the sense of "I should be free to do what I want". An additional concept, and the one I am actually getting to, is that of "being who you are". For example, the GLBTA community often justifies their sexual behaviour by saying they were "born this way".

Which brings me to the topic at hand: Beards.

There is a severe inconsistency in our culture that justifies abberrant and controllable behaviour, behaviour which has yet to be proven genetically related, and yet essentially disallows beards.
