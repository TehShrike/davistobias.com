Today I was trying to clean up my room (nice try) when I found an old Bible that I had picked up at an auction a few years ago. I had decided to throw it away, since the binding is falling apart and it's in such bad shape, but then I decided to see how old it actually was.

The earliest marked date inside is 1894, making the Bible itself at least 115 years old. I couldn't find a printing date on it, so I had to rely on the writings inside to date it.

While flipping through the pages, I found a letter dated February 1, 1904, which I am reproducing as best I can here. It is a sad letter about death: Family members, wishing for it, and more.

The writing is in a difficult cursive, so there are several words I can't make out, my apologies. Additionally, the punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks have been preserved.

I can't make out a few of the words, sorry, the cursive was very difficult to read!

When it says "if you ever come to Perkins", I wondered if there was a Perkins, Nebraska? [Surprise!](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=perkins,+ne&amp;sll=40.813628,-96.70262&amp;sspn=0.286863,0.617294&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.794383,-101.431961&amp;spn=0.017934,0.038581&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A) I doubt it meant Perkins the Restaraunt.

One strange thing: When I was helping my brother on a house in Ashland, I found a short hand written note with the same exact style of handwriting! The letter formation was systematically the same: I would give the letter formation and stroke pattern an 85-92% similarity. Additionally, the paper was the same type and fiber, although it could have been a common peper back in 1904\. When I can, I will see if I can find the Ashland document and do a more thorough comparison.

The letter is rather sad, and on the last page there appears to be a tear spot. From the ink movement I think it was from the person who received the letter.

The letter was not addressed to anyone except "my Dear friend", but inside the Bible were the following names:
> Charlotte Christine Spurgeon> 
> Family Bible, died Sep 1923> 
> WilliamMadison Spurgeon> 
> died 1906-> 
> Allen Faradome? Spurgeon> 
> died Nov 18 - 1945-> 
> Ca?etti? Stockton Spurgeon> 
> died Nov 10 - 1947-> 
> Given to Dorothy Ann Johnson> 
> Christmas time Dec 1969> 
> By Myrtle Bentlty [76 yrs old]> 
> after having this Bible in> 
> her preession a number of> 
> years.
That is all.
