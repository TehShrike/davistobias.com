This is a review on the philosophy behind the movie "The Golden Compass", based on the book trilogy "His Dark Materials" (or "Northern Lights" in the UK) which was written by Philip Pullman.

I first heard of this movie/book when I heard Bill Donahue of the Catholic League put out a short video (available [here](http://www.catholicleague.org/videos/?video=11)) condemning the upcoming movie. Today, however, I happened upon the book in a local bookstore and, in about two hours, read about 300 pages of the last book, and I found myself absolutely riveted to the story. Well written, well built characters, and good details.

One thing that did stick out about the entire story was its very strong anti-God message. Not just that God did not exist, but that God _does_ exist and needs to be killed. This idea, stems from Pullmans staunch atheism, and is part of the recent movement of that group to label Christianity as not only unbelievable, but also dangerous. As this was my first Philip Pullman book, I was surprised to see his unrelenting attack on God's character.

The main issue I have heard so far is that the boy and girl (Will and Lyra) end up killing God; however, that should not be the primary cause for concern. The more problematic thing was the absolute contempt for God, that the writing causes the reader to despise God. In very subtle, and sometimes not so subtle ways, Pullman writes wondrous pictures of how God is causing problems.

In one example, God created a land of the dead, where both believers and non-believers go to be tormented when they die. He appointed tormentors, flying creatures called "harpies", to scream ridicule and fear into people and slowly "drain them of life". Eventually, it is revealed that Gods purpose for the harpies was to get satisfaction from looking for the bad things. The main characters release them from that command and suddenly the harpies are better, even saving Lyra's life in one section.

Pullman brilliantly creates a very visual representation of what he thinks of God: God creates bad things, but people can make them good. If this simple idea were presented explicitly, it would be easy to recognize, but Pullman presents these ideas in such a subtle way that it is only by reflection and meditation that I realized the author's purpose. Pullman shows his expertise, not only as a captivating writer, but as a highly skilled brain-twister.

If my words were not enough to convince you, consider a quote directly from the author: "My books are about killing God", and also that he was "trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief."

The book is obviously anti-Catholic, but highly anti-Christian as well. The main organization in the book, The Magesterium, is obviously a play off of the Catholic Church, complete with monks and bishops. Pullman's depiction of religion in general is clearly anti-Christian-God, as opposed to, for example, Buddha or Allah.

I thought the story was absolutely riveting, however, it's mind-bending God-hate makes it very annoying to read. It is not something I would suggest reading for the pleasure, since trying to skim past all the bad philosophy is a continual process. It would be like an elaborate theater production, where you realize that they are ridiculing and mocking you throughout the whole thing: Why would you watch it?

This ends my review of the book, now I will say some words about the movie:

Here's how the producer is hoping everything goes down: The movie comes out during the Christmas shopping season. It doesn't say anything really theologically or philosophically questionable, so parents will probably think its okay. Kids will probably love it and fall for it like they fell for Harry Potter. Parents will then buy the books for their kids as Christmas presents.

This is an excellent business plan, since it would likely get huge book sales. However, the whole of Christiandom is up in arms because they see this not as a brilliant sales technique, but as a brilliant political move to get kids to read the books in order to brainwash them.

Whether it's for sales, or for brainwashing, I don't care. What I hope parents realize is that, by buying a child a book, you are practically endorsing the thoughts of the book. Too often I see parents doing this without actually reading or reading _about_ the book. In many cases it has not been seriously harmful; however, in this case I think it would be _very_ harmful for a Christian parent to endorse this book by giving it to their kids.

So, all I am saying is this: Would you buy a book that ridiculed you consistently? Maybe if it was funny, but probably not if it was serious. Likewise, I would not suggest purchasing this book. Read it if you want, but be sure to realize the crafted ideas are entirely anti-God and anti-Christian.
