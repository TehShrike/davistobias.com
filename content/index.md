Hi there, I'm Tobias. I write code, think about things, and care about people.

This website is my personal writings and thoughts. If you're looking for my code-related
things, you're probably looking for [Tobias Labs](http://tobiaslabs.com/).

My online presence:

* [@saibotsivad](https://twitter.com/saibotsivad) on Twitter
* I use [keybase](https://keybase.io/saibotsivad)
* I attempt to make some useful things and put them [on Github](https://github.com/tobiaslabs)
* Most of the code is [on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/~saibotsivad)
* Also I have some [personal repos](https://github.com/saibotsivad)
* And I run the [Tobias Labs](http://tobiaslabs.com/) website

Some projects that I personally care about a lot:

* Not being satisfied with The Swears in the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) or
  the restrictions of the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), I made
  the [Very Open License](http://veryopenlicense.com/), which I use on all my code.
* The [SDMP](http://sdmp.github.io/) is my attempt
  at making the internet a better, more secure place.
* Because I care about the state of our government, I support [Capitol Ministries](http://capmin.org/).
