If you ask me: <q>What are you thinking?</q>  
I will say: <q>I don't know.</q>

But if you ask: <q>Tell me why the sky is so gray.</q>  
I will tell you it is because  
in another land,  
far across the ocean,  
a small man sits  
alone on his porch  
swatting flies  
and rocking in his chair  
staring into space  
remembering a day in the past  
when he told his biggest lie  
and said to a girl he loved  
<q>I don't really love you.</q>

He turns the sky gray.
