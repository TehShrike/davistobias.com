I've been listening to "[Phoenix](http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix/e/B000AP74G8/)" lately, a techno-ish sort of music that is easy to listen to. In one of the songs he asks "do you remember when 21 years was old", which I thought was an interesting question.

So I asked it on Facebook. To my friends.

Many replies later, I got to wondering: What was I doing when I was 21? It was a few years ago, but thankfully, I was able to peruse my journals and remember.

When I was 21 I was in love with a girl. Cowardice and immaturity were (are?) my strong suits, so here I am. Alone.

And when I thought of that relationship, I got stuck in thought: Why do women say men are "afraid of commitment"?

One time I was working with an older lady who had been divorced, and she asked me that. "Why are men so afraid to commit?" It took me a while to think of what she said, but I realized: Men aren't afraid of commitment, but rather of rejection and failure.

Freud often took his personal analysis and extrapolated it to say that everyone felt just like he did. I guess I'm going to be guilty of the same thing, but I'm going to say it anyway: Men lower their goals because they don't want to fail at meeting those self-imposed goals.

It's silly, in a way, but basically we think "I'll never reach goal A, so I'll set my goal lower to make sure I achieve it." If a man lowers this goal to "nothing in particular", they'll be the lazy couch sitters that this culture is so familiar with.

And men also don't want to be rejected. I have a hard time deciding if this is pure pride, or a different topic, but I lean toward the latter.

I think I didn't want to commit to that relationship because of fear of failing at developing a real and lasting relationship.

I'm still learning, I guess.
