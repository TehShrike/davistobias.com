These are all the programs installed on my computer currently. All of them are free, and almost all of them are open source.

*   [WAMP server](http://www.wampserver.com/): Setup a complete environment for doing web development work. I find this implementation to be one of the easiest to use.
*   [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/): Used for playing any individual media file. For my music playlists I use foobar2000 (see below).
*   [Virtual Clone Drive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html): If you have an ISO or other disc image, you can mount it like a real disc.
*   [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/): Any developer that doesn't use some form of version control should not be taken seriously. Some use [GIT](http://git-scm.com/), but I use SVN.
*   [Sumatra PDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html): The first time you open a PDF with Sumatra you will be blown away by how insanely fast it is.
*   [SQLyog Community](http://code.google.com/p/sqlyog/): An amazing tool for MySQL work. My roommate uses it instead of phpMyAdmin, but I still use both.
*   [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/): A basic SSH console for Windows.
*   LaTeX ([ProTeXt](http://www.tug.org/protext/) - MiKTeX/TeXnic Center/Ghostscript/GSview): A better way to write  professional documents. I use it for research papers and such.
*   [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/): Instant messaging, with many handy options.
*   [PeerBlock](http://www.peerblock.com/):  Security tool that blocks connections from known bad ports. Mostly used  by people who torrent, but a good tool even if you don't.
*   [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/): An excellent image editing program. It's somewhere between MS Paint and Photoshop, leaning towards the Photoshop side.
*   [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/):  Virtual computers. I use this to run true Windows XP and Linux  environments without needing to reboot or have a secondary computer.  Apple OSX should also work on it, but I have not been successful.
*   [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/):  Complete office suite, with the normal document, spreadsheet, etc.,  programs. Easy to use, and makes good documents. It will read MS Office  .docx files, but they aren't rendered exactly correct.
*   [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/):  Text editor, used for editing code. Syntax highlighting for hundreds of  common languages comes prepackaged. Other useful features.
*   [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/): My web browser of choice. Used for browsing and web development work. I have 11 add-ons I use, more on that later.
*   Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (x89 and x64): I don't know if I even need  this. It might have installed with some other program I tried...
*   Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile: Same thing here...
*   [Java](http://www.java.com/getjava/): Auto-installed by OpenOffice (used mostly for their database program) and used by a few other programs.
*   [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome): Secondary browser. I block all access to Facebook on Firefox, and use Chrome instead. Also used to verify web design.
*   [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/): The best music player around. Plays pretty much any music file, and has some plugins to do other work to, if you need it.
*   [FileZilla Client](http://filezilla-project.org/download.php): An awesome FTP client.
*   [Dropbox](http://db.tt/nIbK3rL):  A file backup program, one of the best. It's free for a couple GBs, but  I like it so much I pay for it. If I could convince you to use any one  of these programs on this list, this would be it. Seriously.
*   [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/): A necessary evil, but seriously, it's not _that_ bad...
*   [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/):  The absolute best for zip files, and for any other compression method  as well. You can even take apart exe and docx files as well.
