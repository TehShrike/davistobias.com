I am high above the houses, peering across my neighborhood at the people small enough to be G.I. Joe toys. Up here the roofs look like ant hills, and the cars are small enough that I even wave my hand, trying to grab them. And my polished green bicycle rests against the bottom trunk, my ladder to reach the top.

Things are different now, I am bigger, older. The only branches I climb are mathematical: Directed acyclic graphs and syntax trees. So I decided to go back and see what the world looks like from above.

Climbing a tree is no easy task - I immediately catch my shirt on some twigs and scrape my arms on the rough bark, continuing upward I almost run into a wasp nest but manage to move around it. As I reach up, my hand slips into a small puddle and disturbs a cloud of mosquitoes. Now I am planting my face right into a spider web, and now a small cavalry of ants is crawling over my back as I wonder what could have been so worth fighting for at the top of this tree.

Almost to the top, I notice a few nests, a robin (with eggs!) and a gargantuan squirrel nest look precariously balanced. I notice some carvings on the branches from a red-headed woodpecker, some moss still manages to cling and even some small grassy weed has made its way up here. Over in one of the branches, the tree holds a bit of kite string from ages ago, reminding me of power lines and blustery afternoons in a crowded city. And here I begin to hear the familiar grumblings of an old elm, his creaking words barely perceptible as he speaks of some old riddle or tells a tale of bright streaks of lightning and racing winds.

And suddenly I am at the top and I feel a rush, the first cheeky gust of wind trying to push me off. But I settle down into an old crevice, supported by the branches, twisting and turning with the motion of the tree. And I look down at the roofs that seem as small as ant hills, and the people like toys. And then I notice the snail just below me, who tortuously climbed his way up here. This elm becomes a safe haven, for beetles and ants and mosquito and birds and even for one person.

Perhaps this is the allure of this high perch, up here where I forget about pressing engagements and quadratic formulas and schedules. Up here the tree welcomes me with open branches and gently flowing leaves. The wind is running down my t-shirt leaving ripples to weave strange patterns as the sun works its way through the leaves and traces its way across my chest, darts onto my face and lazily walks back down my arm before disappearing again.

Perhaps soon I will climb back down, through the spider web and the wasps and mosquitoes, but right now I will stay just one more minute and let the sun dance one last time.
