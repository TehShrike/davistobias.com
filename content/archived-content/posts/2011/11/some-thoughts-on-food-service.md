I did not go to culinary school. In fact, it's my personal opinion that culinary school is mostly a waste of time (more on that later). Instead I worked for several years as a lower chef, and passively gained experience until I moved up the proverbial ladder.

Working in food service was fun but tiring, as a chef you'll always be on your feet. Be prepared to have a tired back for quite some time, until the muscles get conditioned to the 12 hour standing up routine. The enjoyable part of food service to me was twofold:

1) You get to make things! Depending on what you specialize in and where you work, you get to make more or less interesting things. For example, if you work as a salad chef on a buffet line, you probably won't get to make those cool plates and awesome cakes, but you can add a little personal flair by carving flowers and things out of tomatoes and radishes.

2) You get to spend time with people, in a very unique environment. It's sometimes high stress, but a lot of "boring" time spent together, talking about any old thing. Don't let this frighten you if you aren't really a people person, you can also be pretty quiet if you want, but after you spend some time in the kitchen you'll open up. It really is a blast.

The correlations are true:

1) If you don't enjoy making simple creative things, food service probably won't be something you enjoy.

2) If you work somewhere with un-friendly people, you will get burnt out really quickly.

Anyway ... I loved making food (still do, actually), and I loved running the kitchen even more. I loved it enough to start putting a business plan together to start my own restaurant.

However, the one issue with food service is that it takes a lot of time, and is higher stress than an office job. From what I can tell, through experience and visiting other kitchens, this is true from the lowly fast-food shop to the high dollar restaurant extraordinaire. Food service is always a hurry-hurry-hurry, wait-wait-wait kind of job, so it's not always high stress, but the peaks of stress can be pretty high sometimes.

In the end, I realized I could make a career using the intellect God has blessed me with, and realized I would rather do that than continue down the path I was on.

I suppose it was part of my "growing up" years, because I also realized I had gotten into food service passively. What I mean is that I didn't actively pursue personal education of food stuffs, of how to run restaurants, but I had taken this career path because it was easier.

And that's another thing: Food service doesn't really give you much money per hour, so it's really hard to justify spending 2-4 years at culinary school in the hope that you get a better job. Unless you are prepared to really go at it, culinary school is a high cost, low return investment.

Not that it wouldn't be fun, because I'm pretty sure it would be, but you'd better count your fun-per-dollar and see if it's worth it. I'd say 90% of the time it's not.
