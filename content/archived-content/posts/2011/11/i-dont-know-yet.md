Every day she waits,
that queen of a desolate kingdom.
Desert filled with sand
of a thousand years,
no flower blooms there anymore.

Stone walls, built high,
and years pass by
turning walls into fields of sand,
empty and forgotten.

As the sun sets on her desert
she cannot remember the walls,
but beyond them now
is only emptiness.

Queen, high above the ground,
she does not notice others
because there is only one.
Only one man is her rose,
and that rose is a king.
