So here it is, Christmas day, and I've got a few thoughts running through my head, keeping me from sleep.

Next week is my last week at the intern job I've had over the summer/fall, and a week after that I'll be starting up another semester of school. Only two semesters left... I had so many plans for this summer, and almost none of them happened.

Today I realized more concretely, while planning the moving-back-to-school, that I was almost done here, and starting school will once again cut me off from my friends here. And as I thought more on this, I felt more and more alone. I'll be living in an apartment with a friend, and I'll still see most of these friends about the same amount, but during the semester I always feel so cut off and distanced. Probably because of the distance.

But general friendships aren't why I'm still awake at 2am, it's a very specific relationship.

And a real fear that I'll lose the friendship by the cold forces of time and distance.

But when I say "lose", I don't mean how it's normally meant. I mean that, by time and distance, and the inevitable changes about to occur in some of my circles of friends, that the relationship will be... Well, I guess maybe "lost" is the best word.

Set aside and forgotten.

Displaced with other interests.
