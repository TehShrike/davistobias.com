Sometimes I read other peoples blogs and wonder why they posted such things as:

> So ru awak nw???!?!?!? Anywho holy monkeys! Lolololol whts the dillio. I wanna shout out to my homies: crizzinie, sho-dawg petey, and p-mother!!!!!!!!!

I have been thinking, why post if you don't have anything to say? I mean, at least let everybody know how your doing. And, no "rurofl1111111???!!!!!! shzdgl? gggggg!!!" is not a legitimate entry. The following is acceptable, although not mixed with classic humor or things which you could chuckle at (the following is true):

So today I went to pick some stuff up at a food bank, I went around a corner and spun out ending in a decent ditch. After the boys here pulled me out I realized I popped the bead off the tire (basically, it is flat and you can't just put air in it) so I put on the donut. Speaking of donuts, I once saw two guys fly past me at 90mph in a Ford Festiva with the front drive tire a donut! That's insane! As I continue to the food bank, I repair the tire at Wal-Mart (I am not a fan, but it was the only thing around) and since it would take 40 minutes for them to put it on, I grab the tire and do it myself. Except the jack is frozen. You might have a scissors jack for your car, if you do it would be wise to pull it out every couple months and tighten it up and down, lubricate it and put it back. So I used a forklift to lift the mini-van and changed the tire. Ingenuity! That's about it, it's a little late so I am going to sleep. Latah.
