So here it is, the first post in a month. Unfortunately I have nothing glamorous to post, no new writings yet, no more pictures except this one: Click here. I have not been working on any projects yet, except cleaning and organizing my stuff. I emptied out my storage unit because I was tired of paying money for stuff I didn't use, then at the same time, my parents decided to clean the basement to put in a new furnace so they gave me all my stuff I had forgotten about. So now I have piles of stuff, even piles in my car, because I have not had time to sort through them (or desire) and things in my car are still there because I ran out of room.

I am right now recording some stuff from my friend Willaim's collection, improv, composed, etc.. I am putting together a piece and am rifling through some of his works to find interesting bits. I feel compelled to post his web-site address, it is in better shape now: [http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84](http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84) He has some of his poetry up, some other stuff, but still in it's beginning stages. If I were not recording, I would be finishing the "vampire transcript" which I have been promising, I continue to promise: It is not to be missed! Amusing to the nth degree.
