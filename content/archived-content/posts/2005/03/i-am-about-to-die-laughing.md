This is a humor link of the day from [qwantz.com](http://qwantz.com/)
But specifically this one [here](http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=14).

So sleepy, I am making this short. My bro and I are constructing the hydrogen making device, it is really coming along well and I will add pictures and update the [plans](http://geocities.com/cyber_scapes/invent/invent1.htm) with my notes and real pictures as soon as it's done.

Okay, I go to deactivate my existence.
