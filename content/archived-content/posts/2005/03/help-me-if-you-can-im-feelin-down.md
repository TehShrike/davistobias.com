Unfortunately I am already tired, so this is not going to be very big (yeah right).

The Barracks is closing down, somewhere around early May. I am once again heading out to camp Maranatha for the summer, and everybody else is scattering.

In computer news, I had a hell of a time trying to get a server hosted using the [Apache Server](http://www.apache.org/) (apache.org), I could open it using my computer, but no one else on our private network could open it. Puff (my roomate and fellow techie) and I worked on the firewall for a good many hours, and I worked on my setup for many days, but still no luck.

More computer news: I sorted through all my hardware, all floppy(4) and cd(6) drives, hard drives(16), modems(5), sound cards(6), network cards(23), old controller cards(3), drive/inner cables(38), power cords(10), motherboards(8), built computers(12), and ram. The numbers are how many I have, the ram is mostly the older 30-pin, and some 72-pin, I think about half of it is bad but I have no way to test them yet.

Last news of computers: I installed [Damn Small Linux](http://damnsmalllinux.org/) (damnsmalllinux.org) on my secondary hard drive (hdb) and then tried to dual boot it, but [lilo](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html) (the boot loader) installed on my secondary hard drive, making the system boot to win98\. Cutting through the technical jargon, I tried something stupid and forgot to back up my files before hand, do that nice list of computer parts is now gone. Arrgh!

In other news, I am almost near riding stage with my new (to me at least) motorcycle, I had to buy a new battery for it and now I am real strapped for cash. I got my papers in late for work, so I don't get paid till April 25th, albeit, a very large paycheck. The cleaning of the office space is almost done, giving me time to work on projects again. The one I want to finish soon is the [forge](http://geocities.com/cyber_scapes/invent/invent2.htm) although I decided to try electric heat instead of gas because its cleaner and I am having no luck with the burner. Did I mention cheaper to assemble?

In Philosophy, I have been discussing presumptions, assumptions, belief vs. knowledge, etc.. I am still pondering these things, so let me just mumble for a bit: If you have a belief, how do you distinguish between belief and knowledge? I mean, many people believe things like: The earth is flat, the sun revolves around the earth, etc.. But what validation of a belief is acceptable? What reason do you have to say whether the earth is flat or round? Because all science is mere assumptions of understanding of data, where all repeated experiments are still perception of data. Especially with the findings of advanced physics and quantum mechanics, that even observing something can change it's properties. Of course this rule is mostly for atomic equations, but the concept still stands.

So what is acceptable justification (Travis, read the definition [here](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=justify)) for a belief? I am still pondering that. For me, I have knowledge of the truth of the Bible, not through validation by evidence, I have no justification for this knowledge, so does that make it a belief? I don't think so, at least according to the definition of the terms.

Anyway, I need to sleep, I think I am back in a routine, so look forward to frequent updates.
