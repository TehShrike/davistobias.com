There I go again, trying to think of something clever to say, nope. No dice. Can't do it. The proverbial tongue twister (The Sixth Shiek's Sick Sheep (insert crying here) shut up!) has crash landed on your "Title" and left you no escape. Blast!

The weather here is frightful, thankfully there are no fires inside, a mighty fine little blizzard just finished last night around 11 or so. The power never went off, the internet kept cutting out (you know how much we hate's that, my precioussss) but I made it through the night alright. The long, cold night ... insert allegory comparing the weather to my seat of emotions.

Cut to the chase: I am now stalling, writing a paper which is overdue, knowing I can't get into town on time because of the roads (that's pronounced row-ads, for those not "in the know") and wondering how I can make this whole blog post an allusion to space travel. Because I am infatuated with space travel.

Start slow majestic music now (envision fields of flowing wheat, the sun rising onto the mountains, etc...).

The same way that we procrastinate with our homework, we also procrastinate with our space program. Ladies, gentlemen, hermaphrodites: The time has come to discard NASA and push toward corporate scheming space flight! Now is the time! Now!
