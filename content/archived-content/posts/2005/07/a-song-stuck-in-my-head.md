I have this song stuck in my head for days now. It's by a band called "Copeland", very cool band if you ask me.

**No One Really Wins This Time**
Welcome love, I have made a place for you here
And I know every word they say
I don't want it want to make you change

Change if you want, but don't you go and change for me
I can love you as you are
I didn't mean to make you want to leave

In the fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time

If you don't find a love you want
If I have acted ungracefully
I don't want to see you go
I never meant to make you want to leave

Go if you want
Make your way straight to the door
I hope that you'll look back before you go
Cause grace looks back before it starts to leave

In the fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time
In the endless fight of grace and pride
I don't want to win this time
I don't want to win this time

Change if you want, but don't you go and change for me
I will love you as you are
I didn't mean to make you want to leave

It's a fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time
In the endless fight of grace and pride
I don't want to win this time
I don't want to win this time
In the endless fight of grace and pride
I don't want to win this time
I don't want to win this time
