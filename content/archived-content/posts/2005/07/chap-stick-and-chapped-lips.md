So here I am at camp, I don't even know how long I have been here. Perhaps a month? A couple months? A few short weeks? A year? I shall forget this thought before I go insane. Again.

I will write a brief history of my life at [Maranatha Bible Camp](http://www.maranathacamp.org/):

I arrived sometime in May I think... Moving on... I thought my job would be to take over the kitchen managing position, for this I was quite nervous as I have had no experience in the "office work" side of managing. Nevertheless, I started well by organizing and cleaning the office to make it much nicer.

A while later a lady named Pam got hired and so she runs the more office side of the thing, while I run the kitchen and food making etc.. So things are working out pretty well, except for the lack of kitchen staff this summer. I have been putting in an average of 15 hours a day, 6 days a week. Pam has been putting in about the same amount, sometimes more I think.

So things are pretty dandy out here outside of the kitchen. All the staff went to Grand Island Waterparks yesterday and now I have the biggest sunburn I have ever had in my life! It is definately pretty painful, but I have not taken any medication for it. I wish I had some Aloe Vera leaves to apply on it, but I have some extract sunburn treatment stuff that's pretty good. I should be peeling by tomorrow night I think.

Speaking of burns: How about a temporary tattoo, where a negative is held a bit from the back and a focused UV light is placed behind it. Then, after about 15-20 minutes depending, you would have a high resolution images burned onto your back which would last a decent amount of time. And if you tanned, you could even have the image on your back for weeks or months! Booyah!

So I have to go already, but I brought my forge out to camp and am hoping to play with it a bit later.
