This is my second attempt at a review on Nebraska Legislative Bill 1141, introduced by Senator Schimek on January 23, 2008\. A full version of the bill is available at the Nebraska Legislative site. My first review I lost somewhere, which is unfortunate for me, but after some discussion I think I can simplify the review. So my loss is your gain, perhaps.

Legislative Bill 1141 is a bill highly fought by the home schooling crowd, and with good reason. Many people I know have argued that the bill is a good idea because it introduces accountability of home schools. They then usually point out that one home schooling student, whose parents didn't seem to care enough to do it right. Of course, in response to the latter argument, I can easily point out a dozen public school students, known personally, who were schooled very poorly in a public school. Because I am sure we could go around all day, pointing out what's wrong with public or private or home school programs, allow me to argue why I think the bill is wrong.

**Reason #1: It is poorly written.**

If a bill can easily be interpreted to multiple conclusions, it is poorly written and represents a dangerous issue: If it is passed, it has the potential to create bad results. This is, in every way, a likely results if LB 1141 is passed. It is written in a poor manner, allowing easy interpretation to say things as crazed as home school parents must be public schooled or minimally have college degrees or take college level classes in every subject they teach. The bill also allows the interpretation that, if a parent doesn't meet up to _all_ the bills requirements, the parent and child can be prosecuted, leading to potential Social Services takeover of the family.

Of course, many of the "worst-case-scenario" interpretations would require interpretation of the law, and do not directly stem from it. However, I am a very firm believer that a poorly written bill should be struck down, even if it purposes to do something good.

**Reason #2: It makes home schooling economically infeasible.**

The bill requires the use of State approved curriculum, equipment, and facilities. In this way, the State can require the parent to not only purchase/use the same books, but it also requires a parent to have equipment comparable to a public school. This can include physics equipment, telescopes, shop class tools, microscopes, electronic equipment, etc.

Additionally, the annual (or more frequently, another poorly written section) testing and paperwork filing and processing is billed to the parents. This idea is ridiculous to me: A home schooling parent already pays property taxes and other taxes which exist solely to fund the public schools, they do not receive a tax refund for not utilizing the public school, and they are expected to pay _additional_ fees above and beyond what a public schooled student is expected to pay.

**Reason #3: It will create more taxes and bureaucracy.**

Parents of home schools will be required to turn in mountains of paperwork to demonstrate that their children are being trained according to State regulations. Parents will also be required to turn in paperwork to demonstrate that they have had "formal education," that they have taken classes directly related to the things they are teaching, and that they are following the curriculum requirements. Also, thorough testing of the home schooled students must be done, and this accompanied by a rather lengthy review of the student written by the tester.

None of the government paper pushers mentioned above exists. None of the buildings needed to store these people, their papers, their testing equipment, filing their papers, etc. exist. To put it very simply: None of these things exist. This means that, quite unlike adding to an existing infrastructure, new buildings, new office workers, new testing employees, new computer systems, and new everything will need to be organized and built. You can expect that this organization will need its own facilities, since the number of home schools is increasing rapidly.

**Reason #4: It is not needed, and was not requested.**

So far as I have been able to find out, the bill was not requested by anyone in particular, nor has anyone been hammering on Senator Schimeks door for any similar bill. This is usually the case when a law maker has some pet project, or is quietly lobbied by big organizations such as the National Department of Education. This bill does not represent the public's desire, that is, the public has not said that such a bill was necessary.

Further, I would posit that the bill is unnecessary because home schooled students do at least as well, if not better, on average than public schooled students. I certainly have bias on this remark, but allow me to point to a significant study done by Dr. Brian Ray, titled "_Strengths of TheirOwn: Home Schoolers Across America._" This was written in 1997, but was a study of over 5,000 home school students, and found them, on the average, to out-perform public school students by 30 to 37 percent. That report is not available online, however, a 1998 study is available [here](http://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v7n8/), and says many similarly good things about home school students.

Similarly, a 2004 study (available [here](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3955/is_200404/ai_n9383889)) shows that home school students perform at least as good when entering college as their counterpart public school students.

In all, the major argument for the necessity of this bill comes from the fact of the occasional home school student whose parents did not work very hard at educating the child. However, I would argue that there are at least as many (by percentage) public school students who remain in a similarly "poor educated" state and, I would argue, the percentage of public school students who have no desire to learn is aberrantly high when compared to home schooled students.

**Reason #5: It kills home schooling efforts, in practicality.**

One of the major reasons for home school success rests on the fact that a home school is not required to teach in a specific manner. This breeds new ideas, efficiency of teaching, and better curriculum. Further, another reason for success is that home schooled students are not taught in a necessarily sequential manner. This idea is very foreign to many public school students, however, it is one of the bigger reasons for success.

LB 1141 requires sequential schooling, with State approved curriculum and equipment, thus in effect making home schooling the same as public schooling. This point, I feel, needs to be hammered in a bit more: The biggest difference between a public school and a home school is in the curriculum and the method of teaching. To require the curriculum and teachingmethod to be the same as a public school is tantamount to requiring home schooled students to attend a public school.

**Reason #6: It creates a disparity between public/home school consequence.**

If a home schooled student fails to pass the evaluation (technically, there is not "test" to pass, just a set of unbounded evaluations; another reason to call it a poorly written bill) they are required to be sent to a public school, or the parents and children are both prosecuted with truancy laws.

Now, stop. Evaluate the previous statement. Just ask one thing: If a public schooled student doesn't pass an annual State test, are they required to go to a private school? The answer is a seemingly obvious No, however, public school students are routinely "passed" through a class without proper knowledge. Further, NO public school student is required to take a similar evaluation, so it creates a stricter requirement for a home schooled student.

This, and other requirements and consequential results of non-compliance, make a unique situation where a public schooled student would never find themselves: Upon failing a class, you are required to go to a private school or face prosecution. This is what I call an injustice to home schooled students, and a disparity in the law.

In summary, I would like to point out a few other ideas: It is presently a legally allowed practice to home school your children. We who home school or would like to do so when we have children need to be involved in educating the general public on why home schooling is a good idea. We also need to help home schools to be constantly evaluating their students; to be sure they are learning at a sufficient rate. We cannot prevent people from thinking poorly of home schooling, but we can limit their reasons to control our educational practices. By assuring quality education to our own children, we are doing our parental duty and reassuring the public of our aptitude.

Lastly, for those who understand the necessity of home schooling, please (please please please please) join the Home Schooling Legal Defense, any local Home Schooling groups, and help out your fellow home schools by encouraging them regularly. It is a lot of work, and the HSLDA provides a great service to protect your rights.

That is all.
