Three of the greater things God has bestowed upon the common man.

Today I have been pondering heavily whether to retire from my position at an esteemed company, mostly for economic reasons. I am paid a reasonable $10 per hour, but working part time of 4 hours per day leaves me (subtracting gasoline, extra time spent, etc.) earning an effectual $5 per hour. This is not very good.

The main issue is twofold: To be able to arrive on time I must cease my studying a full hour before work starts. After work is finished, it takes me an hour to get home and clean up (mildly dirty work) before I am ready to do anything, studying included. This makes my effectual hours worked to be 6\. If I worked more than four hours at a time this would help, but class schedules prevent this.

Anyways, I have tentatively decided to quit, even though it is a good job. I will hand in my resignation Monday unless I hear a good reason to stay.

Albert Einstein once said, "If one studies too zealously, one easily loses his pants." This being the case with myself, minus the pants problem, I have decided to do something about it: Not change it. This due to time constraints. Ackh!
