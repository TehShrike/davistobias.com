In the past I have struggled with various sins. I used to have a very hot temper, and, although I have learned a lot of patience since then, even now certain things can really get me mad. I used to be very prideful, although now I am more humble than Moses himself. Actually, the obvious satire of the preceding statement is a triple twist: I take pride in the fact that I can make jokes about my lack of humility. Seriously.

Let me explain something: I am proud. Of all sins that I commit, this one seems to really stand at the root. In my struggles with anger, it was largely a sense of pride that made me rage. I wanted people to recognize what I had done, and to thank me for my works. In my struggles with self-discipline, I have pride which says that I don't need accountability. In my struggles with sexual thoughts and temptations, it was my pride which said that I could fight it by myself, that I didn't need God's help.

It is also my pride which keeps me from praying out loud to the God who should (and usually does) hold my affections. I confess to you (the internets?) that I find it difficult to pray out loud. Not because I don't think God can hear me, and not because of any other reason than this: I don't want to seem silly. Isn't that a strange thing? I don't mind acting the fool in certain ways in front of my friends, but I don't want to seem silly when I pray privately in my car. How foolish I am! How strangely and ridiculously proud I am!

In the past I have struggled to a very large degree with sexual thoughts, but a while back I sought the Lord for strength and surrendered these things to Him. I realized then that it was pride that made me not want to ask for help. It was my intense and absurd pride that held me back from asking God to help me. "I can do it myself", I would think, and then wonder why I couldn't gain ground. "The Lord will help me, if I need it, but I don't need to ask", I would reason. But over and over the Bible reinforces the need for requesting help from God.

In the past week I have had a similarly large struggle with sexual sins and realized today that I was trying again to fight them on my own. And then I realized my pride again when I began to confess myself to God and had much difficulty in praying out loud.

You see? It is this pride which holds us back, and it is this pride that was at the root of all sins: "I think I know what is best, in this situation", Adam thought. "I can reason this on my own, and I don't need to ask God about it", he said, eating the delicious looking fruit.
