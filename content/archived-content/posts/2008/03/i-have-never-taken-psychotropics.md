title: I Have Never Taken Psychotropics.

I have a very strange thing to tell you, it involves me hallucinating: Last weekend, on Friday, I took a Calculus exam. For those who care, which I count as a maximum of two, it was on critical points and double integration. I had a good time, but I am not sure I got all the answers right. I won't get back my test until tomorrow, so who knows?

I digress: After I took the exam, I walked back to the student hang-out area to do some more studying and this is what happened: I saw everything in math. It was very "trippy". It was not at all like that moment in "A Beautiful Mind" where Russel Crowe plays the brilliant mathematician John Nash, and you see a screen of scrolling numbers and functions and etc. The best way I could describe it is like this: If you learn a foreign language (which I haven't, being American) you reach a point where you no longer need to consciously translate that language into your native tongue, and it becomes subconscious.

This subconscious thing is what was happening. My brain was taking what I saw around me and translating it to math and then to English. Or something. I don't really know, it was just really wild. Later that night my brother and I were talking politics, but I kept hearing everything he said as functions of multiple variables, constrained to certain points... It was very distracting, and difficult to follow him. Later that night, I had dreams of mathematics. Integrals over functions with ten thousand variables and streams of thought following constraints of multiple functions.

I won't lie. It was awesome.

Now I am back to normal, and I am seeing the world as it normally is. It's kind of disappointing, actually. I was hoping I would turn into one of those savant mathematicians... Rats.
