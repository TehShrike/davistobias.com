Where is the beginning of a story, of this story? Could I say it began at my birth? At my many points of drastic change? I think this story begins at the end of another story which I read so many years ago. I have heard it said that a good story starts with the love of a woman, but I think it starts with love. Just love.

And so, this story begins with love, love for a person, a child, written in a book most people called "fiction". I don't want to tell you the name of this book (most of you have never heard of it) because I feel that it is a secret, an intimate secret. It is intimate because I fell in love with a child who only existed in pages, a child no one knows, but who I know.

And I don't tell anyone about this because I don't think they will understand what I mean. I desperately want someone to say "I know what you mean, and I am lonely also." I am lonely because this child is not here, but every child I see reminds me a little of him.

You ask me why I love this child? It is because he taught me wat it means to love, he taught me the value of life and innocence, he taught me how to be alive.

This is my secret. This is my confession. I have let a child capture my heart, knowing he would leave, and now I am alone.

Where are you?
