So this is a short update to all my friends and readers. I was on a panel for a public forum on Intelligent Design (ID) versus Evolution, which admittedly has it's limitations for a Christian, and so I spent an entire week studying up on everything, preparing an 11 page argument from the ground up, sweating and pouring everything into it.

It turns out I didn't need to bother, since the evolution side was not only crippled in their arguments (only one person had time to prepare), and by the fact that one of their party didn't show up (still don't know why), and by the fact that the main speaker mumbled a lot (sorry Clint, but I couldn't hear you sometimes), but by the fact that one of the panelists didn't take the forum seriously, didn't take the arguments seriously, and treated the entire thing as a joke.

So basically, I think that the ID side made a good presentation, making logical arguments and so on. Of course, I am a bit biased, but it gets better: The school newspaper (the Daily Nebraskan) published an Opinion article today, you can read it [here](http://www.dailynebraskan.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=2e3703c2-c70e-478c-9de2-7324454eee0a), which had my sides splitting with laughter. The online versions last couple sentences are slightly different than the paper version, but the digital is funnier. I will quote it for you:
> At the forum, Tobias Davis, a sophomore biological engineering major, said: "It's reasonable to infer design on biological systems."> 
> No it isn't. But doesn't he sound convincing?
If that is not the most sound argument I have ever heard, I really don't know what is. I should tell that to my math teacher when I get back my exam scores:
"It's reasonable to infer you didn't study."
"No it isn't. But don't you sound convincing."

You seriously need to read the rest of that piece, it is sad but side splittingly hilarious! I don't even know where to begin! Even the evolutionists thought the article was bad, read the long comment by Rory Larson, [here](http://www.dailynebraskan.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticleComments&amp;ustory_id=2e3703c2-c70e-478c-9de2-7324454eee0a#e86ec223-8698-42f1-9b7c-664fc4810286), about five pages down.

Anyway, thanks for your prayers. I was able to record most of it, I think, but the video editor machine wasn't working today so you will have to wait till next week to see it on YouTubes or whatever.
