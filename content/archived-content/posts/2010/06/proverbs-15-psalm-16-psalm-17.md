# Proverbs 15

I have been thinking about how the use of swearing has become more and more prevalent, and among the other reasons it shouldn't be used comes Proverbs 15:4 "A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit." Words have a lot of power, it says here and elsewhere, and perverseness of words breaks a person down. I was thinking of C____, who allows dirtiness to creep in sometimes--not with swearing, but with very negative thoughts which are also unwholesome--and that really demonstrates this verse. But then I, knowing this truth, take part in or do the same, and so bring condemnation on myself. Lord help me to remember to use my words as a "tree of life"!

# Psalm 16

The theme seems to me to be "rejoicing in Gods wisdom, given to me". David reminds us of our need for God in vs 2 "my goodness is nothing apart from You", and reminds us of Gods grace and compassion in vs 9-10 "therefore my heart is glad ... You will not leave my soul in Sheol". The joy I get from just _knowing_ God and being in his presence should be a real "fullness", as it says in vs 11.

# Psalm 17

This was a strange one for me to read--David says things like "You have tried me and found nothing". Does he really mean that he is sinless? It seems that when David asks God to strike down the wicked, that he also talks about how pure he is. What a strange thing, I do not yet understand it.
