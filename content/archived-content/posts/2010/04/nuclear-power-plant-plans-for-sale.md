For sale, by me, for a limited time only: Complete detailed plans for a fully functional nuclear power plant for a low cost of 120,000$. (Purchases made in bullion or in cash will receive _significant_ discounts)

Nuclear power plants can be of great benefit to communities numbering in the 20,000 to 100,000\. The cost of fuel is comparatively low, depending on your local governance, and in this earth-friendly culture, you can be sure that nuclear power plants produce little to no carbon or sulfur dioxides, a great benefit if you are still jockeying for a position in the U.N.

**Completed plans will include:**

Full architectural plans for a generic setup. (Desalinization plants for near-ocean operations will be extra, as will other non-standard add-ons, but can be provided.)

Detailed electronic control system schematics. (The safety mechanisms match those of the generation III models.)

Complete construction plans for assembly of the reactor core.

Additionally, full construction steps for the building construction can be supplied, at additional cost.
