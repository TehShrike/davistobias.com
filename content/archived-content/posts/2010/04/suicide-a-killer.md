Main thesis is found on page 29 and following: Suicide is an unpardonable sin. He does so with these seven "proofs":

1.  suicide is a form of atheism
2.  it is satanic seduction
3.  it is sin of hypocrisy
4.  it is sin of pride
5.  it is sin of lying
6.  it is an attack on the body of Christ
7.  it is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost: "The Bible says our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. To destroy that temple is blasphemy." That is his major argument, no additional proofs given
pgÂ  85 "Job's real victory was conquering himself."

Wilkerson is obviously an Armenian, where he is convinced that Job "saved himself", not in some figurative sense, but he says clearly on pg 86 that "Job did four simple things, all on his own ... he believed in God"

But Wilkerson doesn't see (even though he just as well states it explicitly) that Job did not turn to God until _God_ revealed Himself. Wilkerson even says "there was not one sign..." on pg 88, but he doesn't see the obvious sign: God spoke to Job, face to face! Surely that is a sign!

Wilkerson's "cure" is as absurd as his statement that Job didn't see a sign: Buy grapes, visualize them on the vine, pretend you are cured of depression, etc. All of these (pg 98) are silly, and don't address the heart of the issue at all.

pg 100 "all loneliness is a result of having strayed from His presence." (see Psalm 16:11) But then he goes on to say that "even Jesus gets lonely!" But how can Jesus stray from God's presence? And later: "I am convinced that His greatest need is to have a one-to-one personal communication with those He left here on earth." W, says that God has a _need_. This is the same idea that C___ W___ has, that God _needs_ to talk to us, that's why He made us.
