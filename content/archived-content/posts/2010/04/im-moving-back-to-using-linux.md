title: I'm moving back to using Linux

I built a 64 bit computer a while back, and I decided to run Windows  on it, since my desire was to run SolidWorks and AutoCAD, two programs  that (because of the size and limited user base) are rather difficult to  get running in Linux. After about a half year of running and using  Windows 7 I  can say that I really want my Linux back.

Don't get me wrong, I  like Windows 7 pretty well--I even wrote [a  review](http://www.davistobias.com/blog/665/windows-7-review-by-linux-fan) stating such. But most of the stuff I do on my home computer  is with coding, and Linux is really well suited for general coding and  scripting.

I have heard people say things like "If you want to get  any _real_ work done, use _[operating system they like best]_"  but I don't feel this is a useful thing to say. It would be like saying  "If you want to get any _real_ work done, grab a 16 pound sledge  hammer". The statement assumes what work you want to get done.

While  I _personally_ will never buy a Mac, and I often complain about  the fanatical and rude (unknowingly, usually) fan base, I really think  that a professional photographer or video editor would be well served by  buying a Mac. Choosing the "right" operating system has a complicated  mix of variables, all really adding up to the general question: How hard  is it for me to get the job done that I am trying to do.

Running  SolidWorks or AutoCAD on a Ubuntu (my personal favorite) operating  system takes much more effort than doing the same thing on a Windows  machine. Laying the blame at different people won't do anything to  change the fact: Those two programs are designed in, and have support  only in Windows operating systems.

The past few months, however,  have caused me to realize that I don't actually need those programs on  my computer. I like to play with them, but they aren't necessary, and I  probably won't use them very much, honestly.

So I'm moving back to  Linux.

I'm moving back because the environment is best for the  type of things I do on my computer, things that the average computer  might classify as "hacking", but to a knowledgeable person are just  coding and developing scripted programs.

But mainly I'm moving  back because I miss the _environment of freedom_ that an Open  Source operating system has.

So that's it, and now I have to  get the 64 bit operating system running, which shouldn't take long.
