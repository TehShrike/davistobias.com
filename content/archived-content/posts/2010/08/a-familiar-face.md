School started again today, at the University, and in one of my classes is a man that I met last year. Actually, there are many people in each class that I know from last year.

When I saw all these people who I hadn't seen for a few months, my heart was lifted and I was happy. I found joy in seeing again these friends, and even in seeing these people who I barely know.

There are friends I have who I considered very close, and although we have been apart quite some time and still hold them in high regard. How much more will my heart be lifted, when I am able to see these friends face to face? And how much more when, on that final day, I see the closest friend face to face?

Joy unspeakable.
