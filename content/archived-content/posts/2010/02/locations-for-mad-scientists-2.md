The other day in class I got to thinking about where a true mad scientist might set up shop. Some of you have heard me ramble on about this before, but today I present to you an ordered list, starting from "not really mad" locations all the way to full blown insanity:

*   **Out on the plains:** Most people start here, usually as country folk who have to make do with what they have.
*   **Up on the side of a mountain:** Famous examples include Nikola Tesla.
*   **On a deserted island:** Once your shop gets raided, you start to seek refuge somewhere with fewer people.
*   **Under the ocean:** You can make your airplanes turn into submarines.
*   **Inside a hollow mountain:** Using the hopefully-dormant volcano as a power source is an obvious choice.
*   **Orbiting the earth:** The earth is a little crowded, let's step outside.
*   **On the Moon:** When orbiting the earth becomes boring, or maybe you need resources.
*   **Out in the solar system:** Earth government can reach the moon, better move a bit farther.
*   **On the surface of the sun:** Probably requires teleportation, likely a bit toasty.
*   **Inside the sun:** Because they can probably still see you on the surface.
*   **Inside a black hole:** The sun is too big and noticeable, and you can hide a (small) black hole anywhere!
*   **In a parallel dimension:** The gravitational waves of the black hole are picked up with the Hubble telescope.
*   **In a fully separated dimension set:** This one is probably on accident.
I'm sure examples of most of these already exist, especially in the comic book world.
