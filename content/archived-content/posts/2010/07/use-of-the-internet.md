The use of the internet has been widely increased and there hasn't been much discussion on what long term difficulties may be introduced because of the increased dependence. One particular issue I've noted is that blog posts, even high quality posts, have a much shorter thesis length.

Make a proposition, defend and examine the proposition: This is a thesis. In a book the thesis is on the order of several hundred pages, but in a blog it's on the order of several hundred words. I suppose that even status updates (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) could be considered a thesis, just much shorter.

This shortened thinking is acceptable at times, but I propose that it is detrimental to ones mental intelligence to ignore lengthy thesis. Thesisis. Multiple of them.

Anyway.

When one uses the internet, it is usually to read medium length thesis (blog posts) or short length thesis (status updates), but not often to read lengthy thesis (book size). I know that I do this, and I am realizing more recently that this has built in me a mindset of laziness. This bothers me greatly.

I'm not exactly sure what needs to be done, so over the next couple weeks I will be analyzing my internet useage and trying to determine how it should change.

The RSS reader mechanism is a great way to keep up to date with friends, if they post blog updates for example, and maybe paying attention to "the news" (I don't do this at all) might be a good thing, so I think I'll try to limit my internet useage to that.
