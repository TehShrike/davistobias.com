Was it really that hard to let go?

That is enough of that, I guess. The funeral is over, I wasn't able to visit with many friends. Maybe next week at the wedding we can meet over happier circumstances.

I know so many women who are in bad situations, or who have emotional damage, and I want to help them. I want to help guys as well, but since they lock away their emotions I just can't see them as well.

I have been driving in this heat for too long, and no air cooling has made me super sweaty and exhausted.

Church tomorrow!
