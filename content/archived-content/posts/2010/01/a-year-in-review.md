It is good, I think, to periodically review one's past life. Not to wallow in self-pity or regret, and not to be filled with pride over how many challenges one has accomplished, but to take take note of one's "inner man", to seek to understand.

So here it is, nearing midnight, and I am reflecting on another year gone by. Another year of failures and regrets, of life half spent and inner conflicts never resolved. Another year of should haves, of would haves, of broken promises and empty dreams.

And yet there is within me a hope and a peace that burns fiercer than any earthly fire.

There is an anticipation for more, a quickening of my heart, when I look forward.

I have purpose, and it is being directed by someone who is far wiser than myself.

_"A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps." (Proverbs 16:9)_
