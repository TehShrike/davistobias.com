This morning's reading included Proverbs chapter 6, which has a few verses which I have been thinking about. The writer talks about the "seductress" in verses 24-35, where he says that the law is a light which keeps you from her. The two verse sections of interest to me were in 27-28, which says
> Can a man take fire to his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be seared? (Proverbs 6:27-28)
These seem obvious enough to me. Hint: The answer to both of them is no.

Now, some may argue that you _can_ walk on hot coals and not be burned, and they will point to fire walkers and the like. But fire walking existed nearly as far back as history records, so I doubt that such things were unknown to the author. In fact, a quick search shows that the Lord promises to protect us, even so we could walk through fire unharmed.
> <span id="isa43-2">When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, Nor shall the flame scorch you. (Isaiah 43:2)</span>
My first instinct is to say that, walking through fire without being harmed is likely only something that can be done with "supernatural" powers, aka, spiritual forces.

But what verse I was really interested in was verse 30-31, which seems a little out of place, and has been used (usually ignoring verse 31) to argue the idea of communism:
> People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving. Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold; he may have to give up all the substance of his house. (Proverbs 6:30-31)
When I read this passage this morning, it seemed a little out of place. The author talks about the adulteress woman and the harlot, and then interrupts to say something about a thief. What's up with that?

After some initial thinking, I wondered if the author was saying that people may understand if you have a moment of weakness and commit adultery with another woman. I mean, maybe she's totally beautiful or something.

However, that didn't really seem to go with the rest of the verses, especially verse 33 which says it will be a reproach to him. So now that I have had a morning to think about it, I think the author is basically saying this:
> If a guy is really poor, people won't be too upset about it if he steals to get some food. I mean, the guy is starving! But even though they forgive the guy, he still has to pay restitution, as much as the law says he has to pay, and not a penny less. And if it's the case that people still enforce the law on some poor dude who didn't seem to have any other choice, how much more for someone who is just carried away with passion? Dudes, seriously, you'd have to be an idiot to do that. (Tobias Davis Paraphrase)
