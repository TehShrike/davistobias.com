This is a review of last Sunday's sermon and a personal study of the thing.

On Sunday my pastor talked about the idea of spiritual blindness, reading about the concept in Acts 28:17-27, where Paul tells of how he got to Rome. Though Paul had done nothing against the Jewish customs, the leaders had accused him. When he was examined by the civil authorities, they found nothing against him, yet the Jews wanted to put him to death.

The Jewish leaders were presented with the evidence, yet refused to be convinced.

In verses 26-27, the prophet Isaiah says that the people will hear and see, but they will not understand or perceive because "their eyes they have closed". The people had blinded themselves to the truth, but they could not see it.

The idea of spiritual blindness is found in many places in scripture, I will list a few here (italics added for emphasis):
> This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, having their understanding darkened, being alienated from God, because of the ignorance that is in them, _because of the blindness of their heart_ (Ephesians 4:17-18)
> For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel... (Romans 11:25)
Why does this spiritual blindness exist? In part, it is because the human mind is against God, as it says:
> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be. (Romans 8:7)
This should concern us, that we could be blinded to the sin in our lives, or that we could be blinded to the truth of God's Words. However, we know that it is God who can fix this state of blindness:
> For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of Jesus Christ. (2 Corinthians 4:6)
We should not be surprised when people read the Bible and do not understand; much like the Jews who had heard Paul's sincere argument, which was according to their own prophets and scripture, but yet remained "spiritually blind" and wanted to kill him.

Yet even so we have been given a great promise, that if we turn to the Lord for wisdom, He will give it to us:
> If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. (James 1:5)
And, speaking of a mind blinded to the truth, the Bible says:
> Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. (2 Corinthians 3:16)
