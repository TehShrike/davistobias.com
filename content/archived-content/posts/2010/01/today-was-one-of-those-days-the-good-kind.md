title: Today was one of those days. (The good kind)

I was supposed to be asleep an hour and a half ago, according to my  strict self-imposed schedule, but I had to tell _you_ this story of  what happened today:

This afternoon I was sitting in the study lounge at school, working on  some rather difficult homework, when something clicked in my head and I  looked up with a sudden realization:

"Dude! I'm in school for _engineering_!"

This has happened only once before, since I've been here at UNL: I was  just be minding my own business and I suddenly realize where I am and  what I'm doing. Sounds strange? Let me fill you in:

When I was ten years old, I distinctly remember my first real birthday  party. It was fun, and I made my friend cry, but it's not that important  to what I'm telling you. What _is_ important, for the purposes of  this story, is that I also distinctly remember studying physics. Yes, I  studied physics and the physical sciences as early as ten. I wouldn't  say I really understood them, since my notes from that time consist of  mostly "put magic chemical A and magic chemical B into this thing, and  AWESOME stuff comes out!"

(I'm not generalizing about that--I really wrote that. And I was  serious.)

I have always been like this, but somewhere along the road of life I  lost sight of this dream I had. I had always wanted to build stuff, _magical_ stuff probably, but I got into cooking instead and spent nine or so  years there. I'm not complaining, and I'm definitely not dissing  cooking--I would still love to open a restaurant someday.

What I'm saying is that today, for the first time since I've been at  school, I realized with a sense of clarity that I am doing exactly what  I've always wanted to do and learning exactly what I've always wanted to  learn.

I'm probably going to cry out of joy: Dudes and Dude-ettes, _I am  totally in school for engineering!_

I was just so stoked that I had to tell somebody, and I thought I would  share my excitement with all of you.
