During my first week of the current semester I had the privilege of spare time, and this time I spent doing some final research on some scientific stuff that I won't bore you with here. During the process I came across some boxes in the Engineering Library at UNL, these boxes were the size of a paper sheet and about 3" tall. On the front of each of the boxes was the label "Plant Patents".

"Plant Patents?", I wondered to myself, "Maybe manufacturing plants?"

But there were about 100 of these boxes, and that would be a strange way to save manufacturing blueprints, so I popped one open. Inside each box I found about 300 little 'pagelets'. Two pages stapled together, on one was a color picture of a flower or vine or some other plant, and on the other page was the patent text.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Chrysanthemum Gloria Speakum Latinum</span>, said one, and it's description was just as interesting: "Stamen is more red than the standard breed" and also "Leaves have a more waxy feel than <span style="font-style: italic;">Crysanthemum Gloria Nospeakum Latinum</span>".

I looked at about a dozen of these "patents" and they were all the same: Somebody got a patent on some plant that they bred with another plant. Not through generations of successive breeding even, just one breeding attempt. It's like the flower guys went patent happy "Hahahaha! Let's patent <span style="font-style: italic;">everything</span>!"

Also this week I had a class about mechanisms. Little gears, swing arms, and all that stuff. Things like the Archimedes screw and gear teeth are thousands of years old but still in wide use today, and I get to study them. In fact, there are at least a few mechanisms that are so widely known, and go so far back in history that they are almost considered physical <span style="font-style: italic;">laws</span>. They will never cease to exist until the earth ceases to exist.

But in looking at some mechanisms, I noticed that some of them were patented. And I'm not talking about the mechanism in the Ferrari engine, I'm talking about a bar swinging on a pivot. Something kids make with their Tinker Toys. Patented.

Maybe you aren't as amazed at this as I am, so let me try an analogy:

When you have two objects sitting on your table, they are both attracted to the ground. In fact, they are actually attracted to each other, but in such a small way that you can't tell unless you have a really expensive detector. In physics we call this magical attraction the "gravitational force". It's the force that holds you to the earth and keeps satellites up in the sky just the right way.

Well, the reason you can't detect the two bowling balls being attracted together is because you have to have a big object to really notice. A very smart man, Isaac Newton, figured out an equation a long time ago that showed how much that force depends on the size of something. I'll write it here: `F=G*M*m/d2`

All that really matters about that equation is that it's been used in just about everything you have ever seen built. Skyscrapers, houses, bridges, cars, you name it, everybody uses that equation to understand the universe.

So here is a question: What would have happened if Isaac Newton had patented his equations? Right now I could come up with an equation which explained how everything in the universe worked, and with it people could maybe make teleportation and flying cars and all the other things nerds dream about, but if I patented it, no one could use it without my permission.

Even if someone did years of research and came up with the same equations as me, they couldn't use them because I already patented them.

That's the stupidest thing I've heard in years.

I'm an engineer, and I will likely put years of research into figuring something out, but I am totally against patent law.
