Hello everyone, in keeping with my [public planning](http://www.davistobias.com/blog/985/summer-plans) mood, I thought I would write up my plans for the winter break. The summers plans were a little too much, but I think this one I planned out about right. (Not in order of importance)

*   Finish Wordpress "[Sermon Posts](http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/projects/sermon-posts-plugin/)" plugin and make project public
*   Finish Wordpress Product Management plugin
*   Some work for my church, mostly moving the sermons over to the new plugin
*   I have a couple web clients to finish work for, and a few to propose working for
*   I bought a trailer in preparation for moving this summer, so I need to move all my junk lying around in the house into the trailer, which also needs a few repairs
*   Belated fall cleaning of the house
*   Quite a few clothes need mending, thankfully I am good with a needle and thread
*   Get some quality time in on my cello
*   Get some consistent quality time in on my Chinese language (中文) practice
*   Lots of planning to do for next year: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Class schedule</span>, daily schedule, fitness/health/workout, meal planning, relationships, spiritual, reading, etcetera.
*   I also plan to get back on the [Religious Politic](http://religiouspolitic.com/) blog
*   Spend some quality time with William, maybe do a little jam session
*   Head out to Colorado to visit some friends
Some of this stuff is already pretty much done, thankfully.
