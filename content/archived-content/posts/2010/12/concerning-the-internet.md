My friends: It comes to my attention that the Department of Homeland Security has begun shutting down websites based on whether they believe they can get away with it.

The situation is complex, but absolutely critical. Essentially the decision that stands before us is whether or not the internet should be directly controlled by the government, thereby regulating the freedom of press. Such a statement is certainly simplification, but in my study of the issue, I am certain this simplification is an accurate one.

My aim is not a political one, I don't speak as a Republican, a Democrat, a Conservative, a Liberal, an Anarchist, or any other type. I only speak this as a warning to those who cherish free speech: If this movement by the Homeland Security is not both stopped and overthrown, it will signify the final loss of freedom of press in America, and I do not feel that I am exaggerating in the least.

I have yet to find a way to combat this egregious violation by the HSA, but letters and emails and phone calls to your representative are always something useful, even if they provide little result.

For freedom.
