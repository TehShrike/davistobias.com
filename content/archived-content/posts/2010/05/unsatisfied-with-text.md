title: Unsatisfied with text

I often write little snippets of poetry/prose, yet I have been unsatisfied with presenting some of them as plain text: The writing itself, along with some accompanying sketches, is an important part of some of my compositions.

Not many, mind you, but enough that I am not satisfied with using the existing Wordpress blog as the method of presentation.

However, I really _really_ like the Wordpress framework, so I am reluctant to move away from it. If I were to use HTML to display what I want, and use Wordpress as the management system, I would basically need to either have separate CSS (or perhaps even Themes) for each page within the category, or create an image for the bits of creative writing that require precision "artistic" placement.

I think I'll just go with the second choice.
