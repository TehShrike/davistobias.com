title: A song I am writing, the first one.

I am working on a handful of songs for an album and this is the first one. The album "thought line" is from this, the beginning: A man who lost his heart to a woman. I would like to see how this would sound if translated into another language.

(I sent this to Laci Conour, who speaks Spanish pretty well apparently. She's translating it herself or using the Google translation, whatever. The message I wrote to her is at the end.)

**English:**

This is how it begins,
another heart carried away
by unrehearsed melodies.

Sounds pass by my ears and enter
straight into my heart,
the song of all time.
And you, my love, are the one
who carried this soul.

"This is how it begins" is a
shower of rain, covering the sun.
Lightning crashes, and
I am swept away by the downpour.

This is how it begins, another heart lost to
simple music, but that music
captured me.

**Spanish (Google translation):**

AsÃ­ es como empieza,
otro corazÃ³n arrebatado
por melodÃ­as improvisado.

Los sonidos pasan por mis oÃ­dos y entrar en
directamente a mi corazÃ³n,
la canciÃ³n de todos los tiempos.
Y tÃº, mi amor, eres el Ãºnico
que llevaron a esta alma.

"AsÃ­ es como empieza" es una
ducha de lluvia, cubriendo el sol.
Rayo accidentes, y
Soy arrastrado por la lluvia.

AsÃ­ es como empieza, otro corazÃ³n perdido
mÃºsica sencilla, pero la mÃºsica que
me capturaron.

This is the message I wrote to Laci Conour:

Hey Laci, thanks for helping me with this!

I wrote this song as the first piece of music to an album I'll be working on over the summer, and I would like to sing it in Spanish. I can speak the language pretty well, and I can pick out a handful of words if I'm reading it, but I don't know it well enough to trust the Google automatic translation :-)

I'll write the English version, followed by an explanation which will hopefully help make sure the translation is similar in feel, then I'll copy in the Google auto translation, in case you want to work off that.

So obviously the song seems like a love song at first, but my intent isn't the sort of love song that one would sing to the significant other, but more of an an introduction to a longer story (the album).

My deep passion for music is reflected in the lyrics: In the first paragraph I wanted to create a parallel between the emotional reaction that music creates and the emotional bonding between a man and woman who "fall in love". (That term is cliche, but helps explain the idea)

The second set is more abstract, but basically expounds on the first idea. The "my love" is a person in past tense, but the singer is calling the woman to mind for the audience, as though she were there at the moment, so it should probably be present tense. This breaks the sentence "And you ... this soul", since it is a past tense sentence but the "my love" is present. I did that on purpose, hopefully it can be reflected in the Spanish but it's not critical that it does.

The third paragraph is probably pretty clear, it's just saying that it started as something simple "a shower of rain" but turned into something much bigger, the "downpour".

Finally, drawing a parallel back to music: It's not always the complex musical themes that pull at the heart the most. Sometimes it's the simple tunes, that have haunting melodies.

That's it. Don't worry too much, in music things get abstracted so it's not a super big a deal, and I can fiddle with it to get the rhythm correct, I just want someone who actually speaks the language to make sure it translates well.

Thanks for doing this, it means a lot to me. I'll be sure to let you know when the song is done/recorded. :-)

Here's the translation that Google generated with it's auto-translator, I don't know if it will help or not:
