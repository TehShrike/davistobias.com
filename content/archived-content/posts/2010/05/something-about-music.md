I've been getting "the muse" lately, and writing down an outline for a music album I've been thinking of for a long time. I have a couple of the songs written into lyrics, and I know in general how I want them to sound, but I think it will take some time to get them there.

When I write down poetry I don't usually do it for the benefit of others, but instead I write thoughts and emotions into what I consider a sort of abstracted form. Poetry _is_abstract, you know?

Often I write down poetry and verse knowing that it will fade away or be discarded: A few verses I wrote on a plastic sheet hidden between pages of a book, knowing that the words would be smudged away after a time. Strangely enough, I would consider these now-discarded writings to be some of my best pieces, yet I let them decay rapidly with time and never share them.

I don't say this to boast in any way, but to point out a strange eccentricity that I have: Some of my best creative work I purposely hide from others and put it in such a way that it will not last.

Why do I do this? Frankly I am not entirely sure myself, but I do think it has made me a better writer in some ways. Judge for yourselves, I suppose.

Now I am trying to get into creating music, and I am finding it hard to do. I am passionate about music: Music is my drug of choice.

Over this summer I'll be hashing out some music and eventually releasing an album here, as well as placing it on some well known torrent sites for ease of distribution. In the process I will be looking for talented musicians who would be willing to play bits and pieces for the album. I'm not going to be the main singer, I want other people who are better at singing to sing the more important parts.

All I know is that music is confusing.
