I have spent the past few days in Omaha, visiting a few friends but mostly doing some web-site design work. It was very nice to hang out with my family for a couple afternoons, that hasn't happened in a long time.

While I was in Omaha, working and relaxing, I also worked out a list of the things I have planned for the summer. This is an incomplete list, and some of the things are very generalized (e.g., how much do I need to know before I can say I have learned Chinese?) but it should be pretty close. Let me know if I'm missing anything obvious:

*   Pick an emphasis within my major (Mechanical Engineering) and list _all_ available companies
*   Repair/restore my Geo metro ([project page](http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/active/89-geo/), more details posted there)
*   Sell everything I have on both porches (lots of car parts)
*   Prepare for the [FE exam](http://www.ncees.org/) in October
*   Finish political strategy plan (related to [this](http://www.religiouspolitic.com/))
*   Lay out full first draft of math book
*   Find and use an actual accounting/budget program
*   Build and polish the [BB](http://biblicalblueprints.org/)/[DCC](http://dominioncovenantchurch.com/) website redesign
*   Learn [Python](http://www.python.org/), [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/), and Chinese (spoken)
*   Finish writing music album, record first draft
*   Purchase and learn the cello
*   Register for classes and generate the full two semester schedule
*   Find and use a project/task management software
*   Invent nuclear battery
*   Keep being so awesome
School starts on August 23, which gives me about 110 days to get all that done. Well, what do you have planned for the summer?
