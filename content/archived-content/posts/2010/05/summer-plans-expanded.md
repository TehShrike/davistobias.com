In my [previous post](http://www.davistobias.com/blog/985/summer-plans) I made a list of goals I desire to accomplish this summer, my roommate (Josh) telling me I overestimated my ability to Get Things Done. So in an effort to clarify, both for you the casual reader and myself as well, I describe in more detail my plans. On my wall I have a paper grid, 31 columns wide and 12 rows high, which represent the whole year. When I wake up I cross off the previous days box, which has made me realize more acutely how much time I waste. Side note: I just (this very second) had to clean out my keyboard so the "z" would stop typing. Cleaning old keyboards is gross. Ugh.

Anyway, so here is the list from the other day, numbered now:

1.  Pick an emphasis within my major (Mechanical Engineering) and list _all_ available companies
2.  Repair/restore my Geo metro ([project page](http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/active/89-geo/),  more details posted there)
3.  Sell everything I have on both porches (lots of car parts)
4.  Prepare for the [FE exam](http://www.ncees.org/) in  October
5.  Lay out full first draft of math book
6.  Find and use an actual accounting/budget program
7.  Learn [Python](http://www.python.org/), [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/), and Chinese (spoken)
8.  Purchase and learn the cello
9.  Register for classes and generate the full two semester schedule
10.  <del datetime="2010-05-30T05:44:29+00:00">Find and use a project/task management software</del> Done!
11.  Build and polish the [BB](http://biblicalblueprints.org/)/[DCC](http://dominioncovenantchurch.com/) website redesign
12.  Finish writing music album, record first draft
13.  Finish political strategy plan (related to [this](http://www.religiouspolitic.com/))
14.  <del datetime="2010-05-30T05:44:29+00:00">Invent nuclear battery</del> Research ticket filed
15.  <del datetime="2010-05-30T05:44:29+00:00">Keep being so awesome</del> Be even more awesome!
And here is that list expanded to explain in more detail:

1.  After deciding on an emphasis within the Mechanical Engineering world, create a database or a simple spreadsheet of as many companies within that field as I can find. Narrow this list into: 10 companies I would like to start working for as an intern or intro level engineer, and 10 companies to stay with through most of my career. Generate and keep files on these 20 companies, and shape a resume for each of the first 10.
2.  I had a more complete list that I still needed to prioritize, but the main things are: Rust treatment inside and out, install spare tire cover, install carpet, install seat covers, replace rear wheel hubs (bearings are going out, upgraded used hubs is about the same cost), polish headlights (they are oxidized, reducing light). Finances will limit the final list a lot.
3.  Clean and photograph everything to sell on eBay/craigslist, write up descriptions for them, pre-package for shipping and store inside. The main goal is to have the covered porch empty of everything except yard tools and possibly my bicycle.
4.  Get a prep book from the Engineering Library, study review 3 times per week for 10-30 minutes each time. My brother may want to get in on the action (also an ME).
5.  The math book project can be found [here](http://www.baconmath.com/wiki). The goal is a rough draft, including the entire series from start to finish with every major section (e.g., "Calculus") and every Sub-Section (e.g., "row reduction of matrices") labeled, and with a single paragraph for each of these sections. (No problems/solutions/examples)
6.  I want to be able to track every penny I spend and receive, and be able to design a budget of monthly expenses, as well as longer term goals and so on. I actually bought the [Zipit Z2](http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/active/zipit-z2/) for this, but it isn't quite up to speed without special software design. It's complicated, that's all.
7.  I don't intend on being proficient in any of these by the end of the summer, but rather I intend to have a reasonable grasp of Python/C++, so I can sit down and know the general syntax etc. If the finances are available in time I would like to take the second semester (summer session) of Chinese, but my main goal is to have learned the set of flash cards I made for the last semester's class. It's about 100 basic words, and a few dozen common phrases.
8.  This one will be more difficult, since saving up for the purchase might take most of the summer. I think I might switch this goal to just plain acquiring the cello in the first place. Of course, if anybody has a cello I can borrow for the whole summer that would be  awesome. If that were the case, then I want to be able to sight read simple music from sheet music by the end of the summer.
9.  Get all scheduling written down both on a printable spread sheet, so that a single semester can be placed on the wall, and also imported into my calendar of choice: Google Calendars. Include all holidays, breaks, and so on, that are listed at the school website.
10.  I have already started looking into this one and have not had much success. Most project management software is either: For large corporations (and so are usually too complex to learn quickly) or they are too simple and don't have the things I need. If someone has knowledge of a web-based personal project management that is more powerful than the [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/) method, but wouldn't require more than an hour to learn, let me know. (Software, general projects, vehicle maintenance, etc.)
11.  This is pretty straightforward. I just realized that a nice touch would be to support versioning in the template (I use Wordpress as a CMS, which is awesome). I'll have to check into that...
12.  I have an idea for an album of about six songs which I would like to record and polish this summer. Truthfully, however, this item is quickly dropping in priority.
13.  I have a whole host of ideas, some very concrete and some nebulous, and they all need to be gelled into a single unified strategy plan. Seeing as how this is so nebulous, my goal is: Make this not nebulous _at all_.
14.  I am officially entering this as an active research project.
15.  While this was meant to be funny, I was actually serious. My goal: Build a real habit of daily Bible reading, prayer, and worship. This means I won't be able to stay up late anymore (it's 3:10 right now).
So there are my goals. I already nearly crossed one of those off the listâ€”since I can't find a project management software that I like, I am just clarifying the design specification system that I am already using to include a system of progress reports. This system is generally reasonable since I can access the project files from other computers over [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/), my favorite backup software. I pay for the higher space, and I have a second free account which lets me put a portable version of DropBox on a 2GB thumbdrive and sync active projects that way.

I should also be done with one of those websites within the week, so that makes 1.5 crossed off the list already. Only 102 days left!
