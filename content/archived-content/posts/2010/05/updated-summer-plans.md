This summer I am trying out a [list of goals](http://www.davistobias.com/blog/988/summer-plans-expanded), that way I can feel more productive. So far I've completed the #10 goal of a project management program.

I looked around online for quite some time, and tried out a few project management softwares, but all of them were too complex for what I had in mind. I just want a way to track how many projects I have active at any one time, and a way to take notes on how the project progresses. I already had a system of folders that I used, but nothing terribly exciting.

Sadly, I never did find a good program. The most promising thing I found was a [plugin for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-project/), but it hadn't been updated for a couple years and required a little poking to even get working. At first I thought that I might be able to modify that plugin to do what I want, but then I remembered a truth which I am still struggling to apply to my life:

The more time I spend doing this one thing, the less time I have to do other awesome things.

In the end I decided to just clarify the existing protocol for my own system of folders and notes, and since I use [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com) to backup my data, every project is accessible at any internet point. One extra thing I did is use [DropBox portable](http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=7729), that way I can even access my projects when I don't have internet access. Since I actually pay for DropBox, and use about 30GB of space, and since the biggest portable drive I have is an 8GB thumb drive, I decided to sign up for a second DropBox account (the free one is 2GB) and use that one on the portable drive. Now, by sharing that account with my paid account, I can keep all the projects synchronized and accessible at any computer location.

I also started on several of the other projects, the [DCC website](http://www.dominioncovenantchurch.com) design in particular is nearing completion.
