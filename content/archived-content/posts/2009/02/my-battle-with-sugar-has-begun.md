All right. Time to pony up: I am a sugar addict.

I was drinking, easily, a 32 ounce shot of soda <span style="font-style: italic;">every</span> day for probably a month straight. Occasionally, I would drink <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> a day, making 64 ounces of pure soda. Dr Pepper. Mmmm, delicious! Thats 104 grams per day, or approximately half a cup of super processed "corn syrup" per week.

In addition, I was eating candy and cookies here and there, and eating out pretty often. I think you could view me as your normal sugar/soda addict.

Recently I had started exercising again, I can run two miles without any real problems, but I started having nausea and stomach pain. I asked a friend at my church who understands human health pretty well, and she said something like "If you don't change your ways, you will end up in the hospital soon!" So I gave up soda. Actually, I am giving up "corn syrup" and soda. But corn syrup is in <span style="font-style: italic;">everything!</span> And I mean <span style="font-style: italic;">EVERYTHING!</span>

So then today I was perusing around on the interblagosphere and found a great site, [myyearwithout.blogspot.com](http://myyearwithout.blogspot.com/) where a lady is going a whole year without <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> processed sugar at all! Wow! And here I thought giving up soda would be a stretch! Then I watched a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-I_uhnwRa0) linked on her site (which explains the interaction of sugar levels in the body very easily) and got to thinking about my own blood sugar levels, and that I had probably just about killed my pancreas with sugar overload. Poor thing, I'ma so sorry.

So now it is Wednesday night and I have not had soda for four days, almost five, and I only feel one effect: I can't seen to drink enough water! I am <span style="font-style: italic;">so</span> thirsty! Whenever I wonder about something, I end up looking it up online. So I looked up ["i cant seem to drink enough water"](http://www.google.com/search?q=i+cant+seem+to+drink+enough+water&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a) on Google, and got a bunch of people saying things like "You have diabetes."

Triple play.

In the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-I_uhnwRa0) linked above, the lady said something I thought was important: You don't need to eat sugar. Ever. Your body would do alright without it. Or something close to that, watch the movie and correct me. But the point being, I can do without sugar, although it is a very difficult challenge.

But I am up for the challenge, and I will be evaluating to what length I want to proceed tomorrow. Read the [blog](http://myyearwithout.blogspot.com/) mentioned, it is positively <span style="font-style: italic;">marvelous</span>!
