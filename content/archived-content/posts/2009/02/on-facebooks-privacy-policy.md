Many people have asked me to explain why I was so concerned with Facebooks policy change, as well as what the policy change actually was. So I will explain it to you, and I will try not to get on my soap box of privacy concerns too much.

There are really three issues which are important in this case, and one final summary concerning privacy in general.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">1:</span> On Monday, February 16th I believe, Facebook made a very large change to it's Privacy Policy. This change in the Policy was not made known to the user, and in fact was only revealed to me because of a privacy watchdog group.

While this may not seem like such a big deal, there are two implications which can and should be drawn from it: <span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The policy you agreed to did state that Facebook was allowed to change it's policy without telling you explicitly about it, although they must make that information available at some location. This means that Facebook was within their *legal* right to change the policy as they did without alerting you explicitly.

However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">B)</span> almost all online services (eBay, Yahoo!, GMail, etc.) alert you when a change in the privacy policy has occured. Typically this is a letter to the effect of "We changed our policy, if you care look it up online." However, Facebook did not follow this standard courtesy. In point of fact, when Facebook last changed it's policy (November 26, 2008) it alerted it's users with an on-site pop-up that required you to personally dismiss it to make it go away, much like a persistent notification. This deliberate act of *not* telling it's users of the policy change brings up the question, why didn't they?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:</span> The new policy enacted by Facebook is more open-ended than any online service I have ever known, and I have read *every* Privacy Policy and Terms of Service agreement before I sign up. As of now, the official policy is as would seem natural to the average user: If you put up a picture, it is your picture. If you post a creative writing or letter or poem, that writing belongs to you. Facebook does not own it. However, the new policy stated that anything *ever* that you put on Facebook (pictures, notes, video, etc.) *belong* to Facebook.

Part of the exact wording is as follows: <span style="font-style: italic;">"The following sections will survive any termination of your use of the Facebook Service: ... User Content"</span> That is, even if you delete that picture, Facebook retains a copy and may keep it forever. How about a more explicit statement that was in the new policy: You grant Facebook <span style="font-style: italic;">"an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose"</span> I don't think that needs any more explanation.

It should be noted that Facebook CEO Zuckerberg responded, noting that it could understand the users concerns, but essentially saying <span style="font-style: italic;">"Trust us! We wouldn't do anything *bad* with your private data!"</span> No, seriously, that's pretty much *exactly* what they said. But how much trust should be placed in a company that doesn't tell it's users when a major policy change occurs?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">3:</span> Because of the fact that <span style="font-weight: bold;">a)</span> Facebook has a history of alering it's users to policy changes, but did not alert the user in this case, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">b)</span> Facebook has grown to be a Billion dollar company and so has very fine lawyers and public relations people, which brings up <span style="font-weight: bold;">c)</span> The change in the Privacy Policy was not a misunderstanding, rather, <span style="font-weight: bold;">d)</span> The Privacy Policy change was a carefully deliberated attempt to secure complete control over the users data.

This is not the first time Facebook has attempted such an endeavour, neither will it be the last. As you can see, I still use Facebook, although I will be increasingly careful of what information I put on here.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:</span> What does it all mean? It means this: The Internet Is Serious Business.

Do not be fooled by Facebook's shiny delivery. If you do not want a picture of yours to belong to someone else, don't put it online and especially don't put it on Facebook. If you don't want telemarketers and junk mailers knowing your address and phone number, keep them off of Facebook. If you write creatively, and want to retain rights over those writings, don't put them on Facebook.
