So right about now I'm starting to worry about my finances. I have, I don't know, about 20$ on me. Maybe less. It's hard to get around with that little of money, I'm noticing.

But here's the thing: I have plenty of <span style="font-style: italic;">potential</span> money. I mean, I have a car that I'll be selling this weekend, Kelly Blue Book estimates it's value at 1200$. I have a pretty cool cell phone I can sell for about 25 bucks, once this part comes in. I have a laptop that I'm selling for a couple hundred. I could even sell my netbook for a little over a hundred, and with a little work I could sell my other car for about 1000$.

So it's not that I don't have capital, it's that I don't have <span style="font-style: italic;">Federal Reserve Notes</span>. The almighty dollar. And that's where it counts, don't it?

It's not that I'm doing badly, it's just that I don't have 10 million in untraceable dollars sitting around in my bedroom.

Because that's what I want: 10,000,000$

Ten million smackers. Ten million.

I guess if it was in gold bullion I wouldn't complain, but it's hard to buy things with gold. It's hard for me to go out and buy a 12-axis CNC machine with gold.

How on earth do mad scientists get their funding? I'm sure it's through some illegal means, but it's never talked about and I want to find out so I can follow in the steps of the mad.
