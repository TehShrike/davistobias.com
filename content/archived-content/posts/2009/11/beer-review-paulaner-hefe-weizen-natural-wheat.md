I got this single bottle about mid-summer after my experience with Boulevard's "Lunar Ale". The Lunar Ale had a smooth finish with hints of yeast, and the local grocer (Hy-Vee has a great selection and a knowledgeable staff) said this beer had an even stronger yeast finish.

A gentle pour gave a three-finger foam head, which settled down with no lacing after about ten minutes. It's a bit darker than most wheat beers I've had, but still has rich golden hues. Aroma is mildly fruity, distinctly a wheat. It drinks pretty smooth, definitely has a citrus hint, yeast aftertaste is present, but not very noticeably.

In all a pleasant drink, but there are definitely beers with an equal taste that cost less. The fruity scent is more defined than either Boulevard's "Lunar Ale" or Fat Tire's Ale, but otherwise it's pretty similar. This has been in my fridge for a few months, so it's possible that the flavor diminished over that time.
