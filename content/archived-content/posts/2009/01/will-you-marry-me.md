A brush of your hand on my hand,
contemplating my next move.
Those  corners of your mouth are lifted,
my first thought distracting.

(What  makes a man hesitate when
he thinks to ask the question?)

We  are at a fork in the road:
Left, right, right wrong.
The sound of  The Voice comes from behind;
I know the question,
I know the  answer.

Now you must ask your father,
and I am losing sleep.
But  I know the answer.
