Dancing
in the pale moonlight,
up shadowy stairs
and bell  towers,
under crumbly bridge,
in musty basements.
My feet tap;
rhythm  runs through
my very self.
Standing in the hallway,
waiting  for the doctor,
and I shuffle to the tune
of invisible drummers,
a  full orchestra
playing always in my mind.

Dance,
dance,
dance.

Coltrane  on the radio
and I can't help myself,
no one hears but me.
