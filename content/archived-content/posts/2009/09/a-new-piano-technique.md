If you know of any more people who would be interested in this  techniques, please pass them a link or whatever.

Tonight, [Josh Duff](http://www.joshduff.com), my house-mate, suggested a new technique for  practicing the piano: Cover the keys while you practice, using cardboard  or something similar, that way you can't see the keys while you play.

I tried it by taping a piece of cardboard with painters tape (no  residue) so that I could read the sheet music, but not see the keys.  Additionally, I taped a few "markers" to the keys, so I could feel "home  row", much like a computer keyboard. These didn't help as much as I  thought, but more on that later.

Some things I noticed after practicing a worship song and some sheet  music for an hour or so:

This method forces you to rely on seeing and feeling the steps between  notes, translating what you see as, for example, a 3 step on the sheet  music to a 3 step on the keys. You really stop thinking of what letter  key you are playing and focus very strongly on intervals.

Also, you really have to pay attention to the feel of the keys more. For  example, when you jump down an octave, you need to feel the difference  between the three blacks and the two blacks to tell you where you are.  The brain can interpret the muscle enough where you can tell which  octave you are in, like the two octave down from middle C, but large  steps make you lose location enough where you would have to feel your  way around to find, for example, A#, two octaves down from middle C. I  suppose that you would probably develop muscle memory after a while, but  until then...

I often play lazy by not thinking ahead or watching the sheet music for  when I should be playing whatever notes. This is a bad habit I  developed, and it required a serious mental effort to work around it  with the covered keys, since I had to think ahead much more carefully.

The "key markers" were just pieces of tape stuck to the C key to help me  feel my way around. I tried using them at first, but they don't help  you very much, since you don't want to move your hand *up* to the C  marker and then *down two steps, for example, since it will make your  playing slower. I found myself relying on the two-versus-three black key  setup to feel my way around.

If you are a piano player, I would recommend trying this, and I would  recommend trying it two ways: Try it on a song you know, and don't need  sheet music for. Then try it on something that you don't really know  very well, and you rely on sheet music to play it.

I know it took some serious mental effort from me, but I expect those  who play the piano more frequently will have an easier time of it.

Let me know how it goes!

Try this covered key technique and tell me how hard it was.
