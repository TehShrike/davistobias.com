A little update: I have started classes again, this morning I started with a class on ordinary differential equations. It is a real blast so far, I am pretty excited to learn this. Also, a friend's husband is in the same class, so that should be fun.

I have been thinking about yesterday's (Sunday) sermon, where Rodney talked about Ecclesiastes. The first verse says that the book is the "words of the Preacher", which is the normal translation. But Rodney was saying how the word (qoheleth) also means something like "collector of information", which would roughly translate to a modern "scientist". Then he talked about how one could view the whole book as a sort of "white paper", that is, as a scientific analysis of (from 2:3) "what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all their days".

I started rereading the book of Ecclesiastes in this light—as a sort of research paper—and it makes a lot more sense to me, of course with a little help noticing some terms from Rodney. So basically, Solomon spent many years of his life doing research, trying to figure out what it was that people were supposed to be doing with their lives. He spends some time on gaining possessions, some on building beautiful architecture, some on developing art, and at all of these things he says he excelled greater than anyone.

But in the end, Solomon grows bitter and despondent over his failed experiment. But notice the two terms "under heaven" and "under the sun". The former is used twice at the beginning of the book, when he tells what his goal is "what was good for the sons of men to do <span style="font-style: italic;">under heaven</span> all their days", but all the mentions of "under the sun" have negative connotations. In a word, Solomon was trying this experiment without living his life "under heaven", that is, under God's direction.

Like many scientists of our day, Solomon thought that truth could be gained while completely divorced from anything spiritual. This is simply not the case, and Solomon's failed experiment serves as a lesson to us. Much like all scientific experiments, even if they fail they serve as something that you don't need to do: Someone already tried that, don't bother it won't work.

Solomon tried living life apart from God, and he failed. He grew bitter at his wisdom and wealth, despondent over the fact that it would be inherited by some fool later, bothered that everybody just seems to die in the end.

But in the end, I think Solomon reconciled to God, since at the end he says:
> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man's all. For God will bring every work into judgement, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
