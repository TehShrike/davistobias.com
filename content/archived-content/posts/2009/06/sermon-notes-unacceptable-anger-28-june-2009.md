I won't be seeing the [DCC](http://www.dominioncovenantchurch.com/) group much, since I am going to be attending the Living Stones church plant. To keep an eye on what's going on at DCC, and to keep myself a bit more accountable, I decided what I will do is listen to the sermon online and make some comments and thoughts about it. So here is the first installation, which is from the last sermon I attended at DCC:

Sunday's sermon was based on Matthew 5:21-26, where Jesus reminds us that anger is a very serious sin, even to the point of saying that someone who is angry at his "brother" and says "You fool!" is in danger of <span style="font-style: italic;">hell fire</span>!

In my own life I must confess that I have been very angry in my youth. I could probably think of a thousand reasons for why I was angry, from being bullied by my church peers to my family aggravating me, and so on. However, were these righteous causes for anger? Some may have been, I suppose, but I think that most of those times my anger has been an unrighteous one.

I realized this problem of anger stemmed from a serious lack of patience, and so one summer I prayed that God would teach me patience. In all honesty, this can seem like a dangerous move, since it seems God may teach you patience through tribulations. Of course, He will do it in what way you will best learn. Now I have learned patience, and have lost my former anger.

Sinful anger is manifested in three general ways, each sinful:

1.  When it says in verse 22 that "whoever is angry with his brother" it is an emotion of anger which is shown as sin. We can't just say "I would never yell at someone" and excuse our anger, since even the thought of anger is sinful.
2.  When it says "whoever says to his brother" it is the word of anger which is shown as a sin. When we speak in anger to someone, it is a sin. We might want to call it ten thousand different things, a popular one being "venting", but speaking to someone in anger is also a sin.
3.  Finally, we have angry actions as well.
We should be careful to catch the sin of anger when it starts, when it is in the heart. If we don't catch it there, it will manifest as words, and then as actions. Later, you might find yourself beating your spouse, but remember it starts in the heart. "Whoever is angry at his brother without cause" means the sin of anger starts in the heart.

Of course, there are righteous causes for anger. That is: Not all anger is sinful, since it says "whoever is angry at his brother <span style="font-style: italic;">without cause</span>." What are the general principles found in righteous or Godly anger?

1.  The anger is "God-like", that is, it is angry at things God is angry at. Anger that abortion runs unchecked, and that many in the church support lawlessness? That is anger for the right reason.
2.  Godly anger is "legal", it is in accordance with God's law. When you become angry that someone stole your motorcycle, you can't go out seeking vigilante justice, breaking the thief's car tires.
3.  Godly anger is not explosive, but is only slowly provoked. When a parent suddenly blows up at their child, even if it is for a right reason, it is not Godly anger. God has great compassion, and is slow to anger. We should be as well.
4.  Godly anger does not take pleasure in wrath or judgement. A parent should take no pleasure in spanking their child; An employee should not find glee in the firing of an annoying co-worker.
One thing I took note of was the statement: "If it is worth getting angry over, it is worth resolving." Too many times I have got myself worked up over something, but not taken the time to properly resolve the issue.

That's my thoughts on the issue, thanks for reading!
