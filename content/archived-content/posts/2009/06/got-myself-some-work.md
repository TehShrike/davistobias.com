I started my new temporary job today: revamping a mission groups web-site, you can view the new site [here](http://biblicalblueprints.org/). I really appreciate their ministry, and they offered me the work Friday last week.

I have some ideas about the back-end, how to make the "Resources" more searchable and workable, change the layout to be more intuitive, and a little changes in color scheme (mostly I hope to define the gray/blue/brown spectrums more definitively). This work should only take me a couple weeks, and by then I will be working with my brother on his new acquisition: A house in Ashland!

Also, The Religious Politic is going well-ish, I have a very large pile of writings that I drafted, my hope is to be able to write an article once per week on a consistant basis. I have considered posting a writing each week about the previous Sunday sermon, I just think it might not fit into the Religious Politic scheme, so it might go here or I might devote a new blog to it.

The house is still a mess, mostly my stuff-to-get-rid-of is piled up in the livinig room. I had originally wanted to host a garage sale, but I haven't really had time on the weekends, so I might pile most of it into the car and drive it to some charity thrift store.

Hopefully soon I will have a camera, that is my next planned purchase after I get money and pay off bills. With a camera I will be able to take pictures of my car project. The lack of camera is actually what has been holding me back on working on the car. That and money, actually.

I got my piano moved into the new house finally, and have not really practiced on it much since then. I also borrowed my Father's trumpet today, I might be able to actually play it within a few weeks: The lip stress is a bit more than I imagined earlier.

Okay, that's about it! Take care, write if you get work, hang by your toes!
