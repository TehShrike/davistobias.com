_A retelling of an ancient story._

A frog one morning was standing by the side of a stream, when a scorpion approached him, requesting a ride across the water.

"Sir Frog, may I request your benevolence in assisting me to cross these rapidly moving waters? I cannot swim, and would surely drown if I attempted passage on my own, but if I rode upon your back I could traverse this stream safely."

The frog was feeling especially charitable, but knew that the scorpion could quite easily kill him.

"Sir Scorpion, while I may be able to carry you across, you may perhaps be overcome with some dark thought, and sting me with your powerful venom so that I die! Surely I cannot aid you in your request."

"Ah, but Sir Frog, as I am unable to swim at all, if I were to sting you I would be unable to rescue myself from these swiftly flowing waters, and I would surely perish as well!"

The frog, being convinced by the scorpion's words and feeling particularly charitable, gave heed to the scorpion's request, and proceeded to carry him across the stream.

But near the middle of the stream, the scorpion quite purposefully stung the frog!

As the frog struggled against the powers of the poisonous venom, he gasped, "Ah, Scorpion, you have deceived me! Now we will both perish in these waters!"

The scorpion, struggled to stay afloat, but being wholly unable to do so replied with his final breath, "It is my very nature to kill!"
