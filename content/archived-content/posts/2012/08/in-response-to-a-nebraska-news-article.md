Recently, in a private group I am in, this article was posted: [Will Paul's backers rally behind Romney?](m.omaha.com/om/db_275159/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=C4oShaMC&amp;full=true#display)Â While the article is the usual political type, attempting to rally people to a cause, I found this line interesting:
> "While Paul's following may be a blip on the national political radar, his supporters bring effective organization, dedicated volunteers and potential donors to the table, and every vote is crucial in close swing states - and Iowa is one."
As a supporter of the Liberty movement, and one who became active and concerned about politics because of the vision Ron Paul cast, I think that if "every vote is crucial" maybe they shouldn't have worked so hard to disenfranchise the Paul voters during the nomination race and at the convention. Whatever my choice ends up being this fall, there is a large weight of a grudge that I carry against the GOP for their treatment of Paul during the race, and their reaction now after the fact.

Even a simple apology from the Romney/GOP people would go a long way to smooth things over. "Sorry our people were such big jerks to you guys during the campaign." None of this "sorry, but" business either. Maybe something like "Sorry we broke the rules so many times and did so many questionably legal things."

I'm a Christian man, and I have used this verse in personal and business relationships many times: "A gentle answer turns away wrath". Right now the GOP has my wrath, and after what I have experienced and read I believe it is justly placed. And even though I wouldn't believe them in the slightest, a "soft answer" from the GOP would help cool my anger.

There's another verse I believe is important, especially now: "Wise as serpents, innocent as doves". We strike where our agility and speed will give us great returns, but don't become embittered by the evils of the world around us. You and I can make a change, but that change must start with those around us.

Who is your county sheriff? Who is on your city council? Are you involved in your neighborhood? I heard a quote long ago from someone I don't know who, that went something like this: "How can you expect the national government to be limited when you can't even get your local city government to limit their budget?"

The raging inferno starts with a small ember.
