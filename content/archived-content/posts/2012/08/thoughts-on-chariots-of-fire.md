Although the film is, at the time of this writing, nearly thirty-one years old, and although I have heard of the story many times before, it was only today that I watched the movie "[Chariots of Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/)". I'll just assume you already know the story, and if you don't you can read the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_Fire) and then meet me back here.

Contrary to my expectations I found the movie to be quite enjoyable, and the story itself reasonably well produced. The movie itself has been hyped up quite a bit, so I was expecting to be let down because of "Oh it's the best thing ever" never seems to live up to the hype, but it should really be a classic on everyone's shelf.

The part that I want to point out is the excellent film directing at the final race, where Liddell is running a longer distance than he originally trained for. When he starts running, the film director plays back this quote from earlier in the movie:
> "I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel His pleasure."> 
> 
> Eric Liddell
There are two points of character development that I want to note. The first is the setting of this quote when it is first said by Liddel. He and his sister, Jennie, are in the midst of a sort of family dispute: His sister is worried that he is becoming obsessed with running, and he is losing track of what matters. He explains his intentions, to run in the Olympics and return to his mission field in China, but Jennie does not understand so he says the above quote in an attempt to explain himself.

The other character development point is that of Harold Abrahams, the second main character. Toward the end of the movie, Abrahams confesses that his entire existence is in question if he cannot win the race, saying "with 10 lonely seconds to justify my whole existence". This is really shown well at the end of his final race, right before crossing the finish line Abrahams face shows true desperation. It is the face of a man driven to the edges of madness, driven by despair.

Here is a stark contrast created by the director: One man runs out of desperation, and the other runs for pleasure. Ultimately both of them win, but I want to draw your attention to _how_ they won.

In Liddell's final race, the quote I mentioned earlier is played back, and the timing is absolutely flawless. As Liddell leaves the starting line, his face is one of steeled determination, the dialogue begins. "_I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast._" As these last words are spoken, Liddel's face begins to change and the steeled determination gives way to a slight enjoyment. "_And when I run_", the dialogue continues. It is at this moment that Liddel's entire demeanor changes. His face bursts into a brilliant smile of ecstasy, and his entire body seems caught up in the moment. The dialogue finishes, "_I feel His pleasure_". This scene alone is worth (and requires) the entire buildup of the movie.

To really drive home this point, during Liddell's run, among the typical cut scenes of the fans, family, and friends, there is a cut to Abrahams who is looking on with what is certainly one of the saddest expressions he has made. It is as though, after only earlier confessing that he runs primarily out of desperation, he suddenly saw and realized that Liddell ran for the pure joy of it. That what Liddell had was something he had never once felt.

Here is my takeaway, the very blunt and high-handed "moral of the story": Do you know what, like Liddell, lets you feel God's pleasure? I don't, and this movie really struck a nerve there, hopefully you can be motivated as well.

P.S. If you haven't seen the movie in some time, or have never seen it, I recommend watching it and particularly watching Liddell and Abrahams' last races. The facial expressions of the actors, and the directing of the timing are incredible.
