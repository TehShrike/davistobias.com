In my dreams I saw a bright and terrible light descend from heaven,Â  and the earth was split open and I fell through the crust of the earth, dying the death of a thousand other men before me. As I fell, father down into the abyss, I heard the tortured cries of the lost, warning of the wrath to come.

And while I fell I looked down and the hole into which I plunged opened below me into a roaring furnace, and I knew my fate and my judgment was near. Stricken with terror, my heightened senses felt the leaping flames as I approached, billows of heat swept past me and seared me in agonizing pain.

I awoke that night, cold and pale. A great pain in my chest from a heart that had stopped beating.

And I, that night so many years ago, with a life so nearly snatched away, realized my mortality quite plainly, and saw that this was what awaited me. Death was standing at my door, and the lock was undone.

This was many years ago, and although the realization of my own mortality has stayed with me, yet here I am, wasting the time away with trinkets and playthings. Is this what God saved me for? I have a purpose and a reason for living, my life was redeemed for a price, yet I carry on with my fleshly desires. Oh God, help me to behave as a true bondservant!
