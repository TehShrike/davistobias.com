I was riding back home from archery tonight when I looked up and saw the moon lighting up the sky, a majestic halo of colors stemmed out from it. It was like looking up at a rainbow that was in outer space; I felt like perhaps I was taking part of a science fiction story where the earth is being terraformed. But one thing that really struck me while I was looking was the red halo that was made up of clouds. Imagine for a minute the evening sky, when all the clouds are lit up in deep red, where the clouds have begun to look like they really are red, that they always were red. That color was "reflected" in the thin, wispy clouds of this evening, only, it was in a halo shape.

This reminded me of a rainbow, a rainbow that we can see in the sky at night by the bright moonlight. And then I was reminded of the promise God made in the Old Testament, where He spoke to Noah after the flood and said that never again would he destroy the earth this way, then God gave them a sign. Remember? It was the rainbow, that amazing thing you see sometimes in the spring rain and in the hose spray during summer and when you fly in an airplane you can look down on the rainbow and see it as a complete circle. Except this time I saw it up in the sky, surrounding the moon. It was the most beautiful thing I have seen in a long time. It was the most beautiful thing I have seen since I last saw her. That woman whose mystery calls out to me and I can't even remember her name.

This circle of light reminds me of a promise God has made, which in turn reminds me of other promises He has made, all of which he is faithful to fulfill.
