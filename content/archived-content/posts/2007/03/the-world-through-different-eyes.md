I have some of those glasses which separate the world into blue and red. They are supposed to give certain images a three-dimensional layer. This works best on images which have been converted to black and white, using the red/blue layers to create dimension. These glasses are cheap, but they do alright.

I have an idea which I am testing out. At 1:30AM. Basically I put the glasses on backwards, noticing that when I was done, the general eye fatigue effect made one eye to accenuate red and the other blue. What I am hoping for is that when I take these specs off my face, the residual effect of eye fatigue will allow me to see the 3D images. Since I placed tham on backwards, I anticipate that the inverse effect is what I will see. I am presently looking for a black and white image to test this on...

I found one which really hurts my eyes looking through the lenses reversed. Now, I am removing the lenses, hoping that the residual effect will be three-dimensional without the glasses on.

It did not work at all. In fact, when I looked at the picture without the lenses on, it was perhaps even more disorienting than with them on and reversed. That was mildly dissapointing...
