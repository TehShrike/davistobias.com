title: The snow has never been more beautiful.

Outside the window of my house, sixteen inches of snow cover the ground. It's like a big canopy has lain itself over everything, except the trees have snow and you couldn't really compare the snow heavy on the branches to cloth. Except you could say that the trees are heavily covered with a blanket of snow, or something similar at least.

Yesterday it snowed, it snowed a few days before that and none of it had melted yet. Yesterday's snow was the most surreal thing I have seen, the snow itself fell practically straight down since the wind had decided to visit another state, and the flakes were real flakes. Now listen while I say this: The snowflakes I have seen in the past were always more like pebbles or odd shaped crystal lattices interwoven, but these snowflakes, ah! Snowflakes half as big as a penny, drifting straight down into my hand, and when I looked at them they looked exactly like the paper cut-outs you see around Christmas time. I don't even know how to describe my feelings, I have never ever _ever_ seen _real_ snowflakes. I wish I had some camera that I could take a macro photo of them to show you! I am ecstatic about real snowflakes!

But the snow turned out to be deadly: On my way to school today I saw four vehicles had lost control and were still stuck in the middle of the road. One of them was a semi truck, loaded down with some huge metal object. Another had rolled over and the roof was partly crushed. Even more, on Saturday night the snow turned out to be the agent of death: A wonderful woman and two of her children were killed in a rollover on the interstate, her son is in critical condition and her husband is having a hard time with it. I personally didn't know this family very well, but they were members of my local church.

Beautiful snowflakes, so symmetric,
your thoughtful shape is quite pedantic.
And even now you look romantic,
while death you bring, so acapnotic.
Weirded out.
