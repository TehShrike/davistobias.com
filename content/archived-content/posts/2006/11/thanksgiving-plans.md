Okay, I keep getting asked if I will make it to Omaha for our little "early Thanksgiving/Birthday party", and the answer is pretty much: No. I have very little money right now, I was given a bit of money recently but since it costs me $80 to get home and back (that might even be a low estimate with prices going up) and I have a few bills coming up. So basically I am saying I can't afford it. Maybe 10 people could donate $10 each? *wink wink* Actually though, I would have to ride back almost right away since I have class on Monday. Class. Hey! I took my test the other day, Monday I will probably get the score back! Hooray!

No, seriously, I am just having trouble justifying it, what with multiple bills coming up. Do you know that my gas bill every month is almost 1/3 of my paycheck? That's pretty ridiculous, so maybe somebody wants to give a missionary a Geo? (hint Nathan hint) No, I'm kidding. Well, sort of.

Okay, so them's the plans for now. See you all later.
