Here is the deal: I wrote a nice little story thing for you all, it is an emotion that I have in my heart put into a story. A short story, but nice. I mean, I think it's nice. But I am going to post it for you on Sunday the 19th, which is my birthday. I just thought you all should know. For some reason.

Stay tuned for Sunday's release: "Prologue to a new generation."
