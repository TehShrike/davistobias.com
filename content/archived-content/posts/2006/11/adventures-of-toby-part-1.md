Here I am, sitting at my computer and listening to David Crowder. But I wish for so much more, I especially wish for a dream of flying monkeys or houses I have seen before. Those are the strangest dreams. I wish for a lot of other things, but you know how it is: Can't get extremely personal on here. Wait. Sometimes I do get personal, in a strangely masked way, you will just have to grin and bear it I guess. Have you noticed how everybody wants to give the "Whats wrong with America" speech? I do. I hear it several times a day at least, "And what's wrong with whoever is this...", or "This reason is why America has gone down the tubes." and etcetera.

I just get plain silly tired of it, for this reason: Complaining doesn't fix anything. Man, I went out and voted today, how about you? I had a friend who complained about the president, but he told me he hadn't voted. That next election he complained that the president would probably be re-elected, and he was right, but I asked him later if he voted: "No, I didn't." "Well then, shut the hell up about politics."

Let me ask you something. If you have a problem with something, and it affects you, should you ignore it? No. If you have something you can do to affect that something, you should do that something. Voting may not be a very big thing, but it is something and if you won't get off your rear end and do at least something... Well, I sure won't discuss politics very willingly with you.

I think this idea can extend itself into other areas: Churches, business's, families, marriages, etcetera. You ever wonder why the divorce rate is so high? Probably because people don't think they should be burdened with the task of trying to repair something, especially if it wasn't their fault.

No, wait. Here I am, ranting about people who rant about what's wrong with other people. Hypocrisy? Maybe so. Hold on, let me think.

I realize this: There is something wrong with the world. So, let me try and fix it. No, I guess I don't know exactly what's wrong with the world. No, wait, I think I do.

Divorce is not the problem. Murder is not the problem. School shootings are just a symptom. Violence on television is not the problem. Taking creation out of the schools is not the problem. Abortion is not the problem. Gun control is not the problem. Illegal immigrants and high taxes and political unrest and high gas prices are not the problem. Those are all just symptoms of a greater "wrong", of something more than themselves.

Sin? The desire to be greater than, or the desire to reject, God? I think this is closer to the problem.

I know a solution.
