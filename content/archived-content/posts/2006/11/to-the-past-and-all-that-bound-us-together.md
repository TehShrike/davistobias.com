Dearest,

It has been many years since I last saw you, we parted ways so quietly. Sometimes I see your face reflected in the strangers around me, that reflection reminding me of how we once were. We shared moments of anger and peace, of joy and love,  we had begun to share our hearts with each other when you went away.

Where are you now? I have heard you returned to my home town, yet I am no longer there to say how sorry I am, sorry that I let you go without a word. My trust in you, and your trust in me, was broken with those few words. And now the time has slipped by us both, separating us with a great divide of unknown memories. Who are you? Who am I? I am not the same as I was then, and you have changed also I am sure. Where did I go wrong, can you remember enough to tell me?

The past has turned into a foggy night air, clothed in mysterious drifting memories, but none of them seem right to me anymore. Another time and I would have said that you were wrong, but now I think it was me. Who are you now?

I saw your picture once, we were smiling and you had your arms around me. But that time is gone, and you and I have grown so distant that I don't even think we could return. And even now, I realize that I probably wouldn't return to you now, but I still desire one thing: Forgiveness. I lied when I said I loved you only as a sister, and that lie kept us apart when what I wanted was to be so much closer. This is my only desire, that you would find it in your heart to remember me again, only to forgive me for my childish fears. It would not be right to say I miss you, I miss what we were in those fragile memories, and we are not the same. But still I wish you the best and pray that God would keep you close to Himself,
