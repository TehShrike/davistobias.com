Hello world!

My baby is undergoing surgery right now, she leaks a lot of oil so I  had to pull off the lalve cover, the  head and the  crank case to replace a load of gaskets. It took me nearly 5 hours, and now she looks a lot like a meteorite strikken motorcycle. Huge hole, is what I'm telling you. A lot of parts missing, is what I'm trying to say. Big chunk o' metal done goned bye bye and said see you later, is what I'm getting at.

I will post pictures for all the world to see when I can borrow a camera. Also, I won't be able to rebuild it until I can save up about $300, since that's what it cost's to replace all the gaskets.
