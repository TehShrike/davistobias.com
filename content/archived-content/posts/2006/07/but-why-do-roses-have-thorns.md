Last night I re-read one of my favorite books, of which I feel naming online would do it injustice. In this book, a little boy asks this man "Do sheep eat roses?", to which the man replied that, of course they do. "But then, why do roses have the thorns?", asked the boy. The man replied that it didn't matter, it wasn't of consequence, or that the roses have thorns out of spite.

But don't you see, that if you have a rose who is your friend on another star, that you can look up at the stars and they become beautiful, because up there on one of those stars is your friend. But, if sheep eat roses, even with thorns, every star becomes dark to you. And that man said that the thorns were of no consequence...

Anyway, what I really wanted to tell you was that I am still at camp, I am still alive, there are only three and one-half weeks left of the summer and then I will write again more regularly. Have patience, I have many hard thoughts to say when I come back.
