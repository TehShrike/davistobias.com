Lately I have been pondering this one thing a lot: Why can't I completely stop sinning? If I stopped the one sin I am in now, it will just be another sin that haunts me, and I lack the power to stop. So, I have begun a prayer, that God would keep me from temptation, that He would deliver me.

Monday I took my final exam for Calculus 1\. It is the only class I took, although next semester I hope to take three classes. I had maintained an "A" average throughout the class, except for one test where my head felt like cotton and I failed miserably. I don't recal failing a test before, so this was such a shock to me that I sat stunned through the entire class.

Anyway, I found out that if I got an "A+" on all following tests, I would recieve a "B+", tops. So, in taking the final exam, I am sure that I got all of them right except one question. Now that I think about it, I am pretty sure I got it right, but I can't remember the original question. For a while, I thought I got it wrong, but now I am thinking I got it right. Tomorrow I will know for sure.

Christmas plans are as follows: Leaving here on the 19th, really late at night, driving to Eppley Airport and dropping off a friend. Then, driving home and probably sleeping a little, even though it will be about 7:30 am. Or, maybe not sleeping? Maybe early breakfast with some friends? Anyway, I will be staying in the vicinity of Omaha for about a week before returning, so anybody wanting to hang out with a cool guy, write me a comment / send me an a-mail / call me / write me a letter. Nathan and I are probably going to work on a project for a while, and I would like to spend some quality time with a few certain friends and my older siblings, other than that I am just relaxing. Getting some quality family time.

Last, the promise: I have been doing some creative writing, some brainstorming for an idea for a larger story I am working on now. So, in the process I have written some short story material which I won't really use, including the next part of "Prologue to a new generation", which I hope to post before this weeks end.

Chow.
