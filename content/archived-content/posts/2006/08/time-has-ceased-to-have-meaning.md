Well, guess what time it is? It is 5:17 AM, and I have not yet gone to bed.

What?!? So I went to town and talked to a friend and ended up in the office (I had to put away some groceries, so I stopped into the office afterward) and that was almost 2 AM, and so I did a little reading and some catching up and so on, and now it is almost 5:30 AM which, incidentally, is when my shift normally starts.

Except, I have the morning off, so I don't have to work until 9 AM-ish. So here is what I am thinking: I have a lengthy letter to write to a friend, and some things to do at the house, so why not stay up and pull an all-nighter? As much as I enjoy the physical act of sleeping, sleep is a thief, and also it seems to be a waste of time. So I have to bugger out of here before my morning crew catches me down here and they start calling me ridiculous and so on. Not that I truly care what they call me, but I don't want to have to explain myself.

So good night, everyone.
