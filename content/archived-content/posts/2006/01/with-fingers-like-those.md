you could pick some deep boogers. And although I am not the first person to use "boogers" in as blog, I am sure I will be the first to reference the skill of guitar playing to booger picking. You see, whoever has the mad skills at guitar playing should be able to pick some really good boogers.

Now, for all those I just grossed out, or those who wonder if a strange metaphor is hidden within the preceding paragraph, pay heed: [Jerry C](http://jerryc.tw/), a cleverly ingenious guitar player, is very good at his guitar. So I just wonder if he could pick boogers real well. No silly metaphor or anything, just wondering.

Apparently, nose picking is considered a psychological oddity, or rather, those who pick their noses at regular intervals are seen as having psychological problems. Not that I put any stock in psychology, but if it's true, maybe guitar players with really skilled fingers will give birth to children with really skilled fingers who will develop strong desires to pick their noses. Maybe, just maybe, someone who cares about their children will forcefully repress their desire to pick boogers. FORCE YOUR CHILDREN!!!

In all seriousness, I vote to forcefully remove the television from children, video games and television are a number one concern for me. That is, children who are in a state of development should not be exposed to artificial realities like television and video games. Go outside and explore the world, climb a tree and see the world. See the world! Go look at the thousands of things within your own neighborhood, go watch the birds fly, go see how flies can fly.
