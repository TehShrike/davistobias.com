Once, when I was not much younger than I am now, I thought that the greatest thing would be if I could face my greatest fear. I mean, I am deadly afraid of heights, but I don't let it control me. I am also deathly afraid of dark, enclosed spaces, but I can manage if I want to, it's not too big a deal. But, I thought, certainly there must be some fear that I have that I haven't overcome, maybe I am so afraid of it that I am afraid to even know what is is. Afraid of the fear?

Now, here I am, 22 in your linear time, and I think that was probably a silly thing to want. I think I know what I am afraid of, not that I would really want to tell you anyway, but it keeps shifting to something else.

Which brings me to another thing involving fear: I hear a lot that men are afraid of commitment, mostly this is said about men and relationships. I can safely say that is not true, at least for me and I think it's safe to assume for other men. It's not the commitment we are afraid of, it is the going to the point-of-no-return, it is that committing is like jumping off a cliff without a parachute. You just threw yourself out there, no strings, no safety net, nothing to fall back on except the hard, hard ground. Fear of falling?

Maybe I am afraid of falling, it's not the heights that bother me, it's the falling. Should I face the fear, and how?
