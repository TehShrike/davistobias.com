Hello once again to my mass of devoted followers, I have returned from my adventures to the Omaha region! This issue shall deal with one thing and one thing only: My adventure to the Netherworld of Omaha.

I departed in my desperately dilapidated vehicle, visions of burning and long hours on the road-side filled my mind as I merged onto the interstate of 80, however, I did have a rather uneventful journey. I began my sojourn at the house of my parents, I stayed ten nights exactly, on the evening of Friday. My brother, whose name is Nathan, was certainly a great help: He drove me around into the deepest corners and darkest allies of the city, even to assisting me in driving the demon of a Ford to the junkyard. While the transmission did slip quite frequently, the short journey to the parts-yard had no accidents.

After much party-ing (pronounced as two distinct words: party ing) and frolic-ing, I departed my temporary residence and returned with a generous man who provided a means of transport and free lunch! Whoop! He is also my boss, how awesome is that?

A couple things happened whilst I was "in the city", which are: A small plane crashed into a field, I never found out what caused it but I took a couple pictures. I took some pictures with a malfunctioning Canon F-1, some of them turned out nice, I will post some if I can scan them. My brother, whose name is Nathan, and I got some more work done on the Hydrogen Cell and I took some pictures with a digital camera, so I should be able to post them faster. I also was involved in a riotous debate on presidential voting, I will post my thoughts soon.
