If you ask me: "What are you thinking?"
I will say: "I don't know."

But if you ask: "Tell me why the sky is so gray."
I will tell you it is because
in another land,
far across the ocean,
a small man sits
alone on his porch
swatting flies
and rocking in his chair
staring into space
remembering a day in the past
when he told his biggest lie
and said to a girl he loved
"I don't really love you."

He turns the sky gray.
