Today I got my motorcycle carburetor back from the shop, I just popped it on and started the ol' girl up. SHE LIVES!!!!!!!! AHHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! Sorry. After my earlier motorcycle was stolen by some ruthless immature (but I am slandering, my apologies) person, I have not ridden a motorcycle, this being perhaps one year now. But today I finally got my "new"--that is, different than the old one--motorcycle to tun. I have to tune and synchronize the carbs, rework the front and rear disc brakes, and find a headlight assembly, but it's finally coming together. I think that it will be ready by summer, that is my goal at least: Road ready by middle of May. I don't yet have the title for it either, so I will have to get that, and then insure it, and so on and so on. But it sure is nice to ride again! This one is a Suzuki 850, so it has much more power and much more weight than my old Honda 175\. I don't think it will be nearly as hair-raising an event to be passed by a semi-truck.

Well, I must be off to wash many dishes, farewell!

P.S. I am currently reading "The Brothers Karamazov", which is a very long novel, it has been worth my time so far.
