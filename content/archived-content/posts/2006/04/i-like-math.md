title: I like math.

Today I experienced one of the most enjoyable math classes so far, the trig teacher was producing an equation and going pretty fast (I'm talking about real lengthy ones: (cosA-cos(-B))^2+(sinA-sin(-B)^2=((cos(A+B)+0)^2 and on and on like this for two pages of writing), this was fun. Seriously, I thought it was great! A lot of the people were saying things like "That's too hard" or "I think my brain just exploded" or whatever. I am ready for more! I have to go home and memorize these equations, because it takes about 10 minutes to produce them.

Note to self: Learn to write without looking.

When I get into my higher Calculus classes, I suspect the teachers will be faster and write longer. It is a story I keep hearing repeated, so I have to figure out either how to write faster to keep up, or get a good bit of software to type in mathematics fast or something. Because I can't keep up the pace with them, I could hardly keep up with this guy's writing, and this is only trig!

Later peeps.
