Now I know what your probably thinking, Spring starts on some... other... day. Well, I don't know when your schedule says Spring can start, but the order of the earth (OOTE, pronounced "ooh-t") is usually a bit different. Take winter for instance, winter can sometimes extend into May, sometimes it has gone as far as June. Or it could start as late as February, or as early as July. It's true, the OOTE is different than the man-made version. So here is how I know it's spring:

When the webs of the spider shine, like gossamer floating in the wind, is seen by the setting sun. When the grassy hue changes from brown to dark green, lush and alive. When all things once asleep finally step out of their earthy beds, then it is spring.

A little thing caught my eye today, such a thing as never seen before, the grass is now awake again. Maybe you can't see it, maybe you can: The difference between the grass that sleeps and the grass that is awake, but there is also the grass which is dead.

Need I say more?
