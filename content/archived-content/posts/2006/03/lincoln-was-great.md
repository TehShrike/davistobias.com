I had a good time in Lincoln, less people showed up to the banquet than I had hoped, but it turned out alright. Thanks to the "W.C.", [William](http://norsola.blogspot.com/), for coming from Omaha and helping out. We had wonderful conversations as always, W quoted a bit of poetry which was thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks to [Angie](http://profile.myspace.com/60907302) and Michelle, for coming from Crete and helping, we had some good times and they sure were helpful. Thanks also to the Maranatha staff who helped out (Scot, Angela, Crystal, JoAnn, RuthAnn, Tad, George and Jan) and decorated the place, it was great! Many thanks go to my brother [Nathan](http://profile.myspace.com/28264591), who came up from Omaha to be my assistant Chef and personal driver, etc... Definitely a great helper and friend! Thanks also to the Choir who helped serve punch and help at the tables. Thanks to that one kid (I didn't ever catch his name) who helped me find my way around the church and get carts and so on, and to all the extra people who came in and out helping here and there.

The banquet itself went without any real hitches, we served some various cheesecakes (provided by [Hipp](http://www.hippfoods.com/)), some blueberry tarts, some Apple Fillo tortes, lots of fresh fruit, and some raspberry fillo parfait's. It was great and delicious, I got plenty of comments on the apple fillo tortes, I have a little web-site which I will post pictures and recipes on in a couple weeks.

Thanks again everybody, for all your help, it was great fun!
