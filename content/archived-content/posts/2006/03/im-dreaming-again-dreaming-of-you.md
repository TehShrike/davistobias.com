Within the past few weeks I started dreaming again. This is officially not cool.

I stopped dreaming several years ago (officially, this was related to the flying monkeys dream sequence, but you didn't hear that from me), since then not a single dream has come my way as I slept. Lately, as in the past three weeks or so, I have had these dreams which really annoy me.

Have you ever had a dream that felt so real that when you woke up, you couldn't really tell whether it was a dream or a memory? I have struggles with memories a lot, part of that struggle is with these dreams which are so real to me that I can't tell if they are a memory come back to life or just a dream. Last nights dream, for example, I had a dream which was extremely realistic in many ways, but once I start to really think about it, it becomes certain that it was a dream. I think.

Have you ever had a dream that you knew "meant something" in some vague sense? I have, I can distinguish between a normal dream and a "premonition" dream. Some dreams are a caution to me, or a guide. Now, I'm not saying any such BS like "follow your dreams" or whatever, I'm just saying that some of my dreams have helped me. They are unlike the next kind.

Have you ever had a dream which came to pass? Some people might call it a vision or something, I have them while I sleep so I call them dreams. Sometimes I can see into the future, my dreams tell me what will happen. Once, I hoped it was more than a novelty trick, that it was supposed to help me somehow. But it didn't. I thought perhaps it was to give me time to think about some precarious decision, but no matter what choice I made real life always followed the dream. Maybe it was to give me comfort, or peace, knowing that something will happen. Well you know what? You can take those dreams and send them back to where they came from. I don't need a dream to tell me of the future if I can't change anything. I don't need a dream to tell me I have some relational tension, I already know that. I don't need dreams. Period. Go away dreams! Go bother someone else!
