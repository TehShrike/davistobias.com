I am right now listening to some really crazy sounding music by Daler Mehndi, it is real weird.

Also, I am leaving to Omaha right now. I mean, within about 20 minutes. I mean, I hope to be of here by 10am.

I am going to a wedding, I am going to a food show in Omaha to spend around 30 G's. That's $30,000 on food stuff. Then On Tuesday I am going to Kearney to spend another 10 G's. Another $10,000 in cool cash.

I would appreciate your prayers that I spend the money wisely, I have a budget of nearly $120,000 for the entire year on food alone, so anything I can get at this food show to save money is good. Also, since this is a non-profit Christian ministry, I am praying that I can spend this donated money wisely.

Peace out yo.
