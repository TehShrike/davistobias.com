If I stay on this path, perhaps I will end up running a restaurant. That would be fine I guess, married to a sweet little woman, we could have a nice deal going on. Or maybe I could just move out to the countryside, raise a family, be safe. I could spend my days being happy, no more sorrow and no more fear. Some days I think that I could do this, leave behind all those thoughts of science, leave behind those books and studies. I could look at the sky again and feel the cool spring breeze run through my fingers and whisk through my hair. Come with me, brother.

And then I could think of things that trouble me, some days I want to but there's no time. I could get lost in a trance, a stupifying dream of never-ending waltzes with the daemons of logic and sanity. Oh to be lost again, to feel the earth pulling me toward it's center, to see the little people again and watch them dance in the snow laden boughs of heavy winter. I could leave to a land where the sun never shines, cast myself into dark shadow, never to return. Come with me, brother.
