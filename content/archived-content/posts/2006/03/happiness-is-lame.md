Sometimes I watch television, I can't say I enjoy it very much though. But listen while I throw some punches at worldly logic:

Commercials for Prozac/WhoCares all say the same thing: Are you not happy? Are you lonely? Are you fat? Are you bored? Are you depressed? Try this drug, it will grant you immediate happiness and true life completion!!!!!!

I'm going to tell you a secret, you can't let anyone know you heard it from me. I'm not married. I don't have a girlfriend. I don't think I have any prospects for a girlfriend. I have a hard time thinking of any girls I know who I would want to have as a girlfriend (sure, there are a couple). But I do know one thing: A relationship with another person (male/female) will never give me happiness or satisfaction. The only true peace you can find and the only _true_ happiness you will _ever_ know in this pitiful world is when you seek after God.

**Newsbreak:** None of the following things will give you true happiness: Alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, a new girlfriend or boyfriend, hanging with your crew, on and on and on...

That's what annoys me with all these commercials, you don't deserve to be happy with your boyfriend. It's like I'm living in a world of escape artists, all trying to escape that loneliness that comes from following your own sinful, selfish desires. But we all know inside that these things never truly satisfy. Only a relationship with Christ, and you truly seeking God's desire, will give true satisfaction. All else is an accessory. Your relationship with that other person is only satisfying if you both seek and follow God's will.
