Greetings all. I will be in Lincoln this up and coming Sunday, I am preparing a banquet at the Lincoln Berean church, a desert banquet. Anybody want to come and hang out? And by hang out I mean help? And by help I men volunteer your time on Sunday to the ministry of this Bible camp? I don't imagine anyone will be interested, but if you are in Lincoln you could stop in after church (about 2pm I will start preparing the deserts) and say hello. Seriously, if you stop and say hello you will probably make my day. Anyway, I have not got a lot of time lately, getting ready for this banquet, so I don't have time to wrote any brilliant thesis. Next week will be great: Spring break! Whoever came up with that idea is crazy, I don't care for it. But it does mean I will have a little time to write a goodly post. Here I go promising things again...
