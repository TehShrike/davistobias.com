Hello friends and strangers, my name is Tobias Davis.

I live in a strangely colorful world, where I see many visions and dream every night of a place I have been and will return to. I confuse people, I confuse myself. If you imagine a world of change, always changing, I will be there with you.

I am writing for a very specific reason today, that being a temporary goodbye. Today starts the long stretch of time where I will be occupied with serving and pursuing God and His direction in my life, I will be serving Him proudly this summer until late August. Until the end of summer, around the start of school, I will not be here on this computer telling you things you don't need to know.

What I am saying is, goodbye.

Goodbye until August returns us fair weather and golden harvest skies.
