Read [this](http://www.netlink.de/gen/Zeitung/970404.htm) post on "food slander", apparently it is a civil crime to denigrate or criticize foods without "scientific basis". I am noticing something in this crazy country of ours (I don't claim to know much about other countries) which is that "science" is looked upon as an absolute, an unquestionable force, infallible and inerrant. That is patently absurd! No scientific thought today should be looked upon as absolute truth, if the truth were told we would find that any scientific thought is still a theory to be improved and worked on, but by fallen minds.

Look at this article, maybe just the first few paragraphs, where it talks about a limitation of freedom of speech.

Essentially, it says that we can't say anything bad about modified foods, we cant say anything to criticize the milk industry (for example).

When did we get to the point where we can't speak out against companies which are killing us with their chemicals, but we could go downtown and dance around naked partaking in sexual orgies and call it "freedom of speech"?

This country is ridiculous.
