Once, I spent an entire day organizing receipts in order of date and time. This took me at least 4 hours, but it could have been as many as 8\. Then, I took these receipts and burned them. Why would you do that? Why would someone do something so strange? I will not say.

Speaking of burning, I suggest a heretical book burning and at the same time take your television and place it on the flames. Burn the television. Yes, you.

I watch television sometimes, but I am not fond of it. I would rather be doing something else, like finishing my forge and building an electrolysis cell for hydrogen production. But the television captures your eye so effectively, and 24 was such a good show. Rather, I found myself watching 24 very often, only this season, but I don't really care about it.

Last night I rode my motorcycle home and experienced a flat tire, my back tire must have caught some bit of rebar or something, so I was effectively stranded for several hours. But, I made it back without a scratch, and the bike rides really well. After a couple hours driving it stopped sputtering, and after 300 miles of riding the oil leak stopped and the front tire stopped losing pressure. I have found that when you get a vehicle that has been sitting a long time, just get it rideable and a lot of the immediate kinks work themselves out. Except my flat tire.

I carried enough tools with me that I could completely disassemble the bike, but it had to be a flat tire...

Anyway, there isn't even two weeks left before the summer staff shows up, and we are very desperately needing more help in the kitchen. So, if you want to work out here for even a couple weeks during the summer, I would be very happy. There are about three weeks where 600ish people will be here. SCARY!!!!!
