Props to me for longest title!

So I was hunting around through some old paperwork I had stacked in corners of my house, and I came across this list that was titled "QUESTIONS TO DETERMINE IF IN LOVE". So I read through them (not that I am asking myself these questions about anyone in particular) and decided they were very good questions to ask. They are not simple "Yes or no" questions, they are meant to provoke thought and get you to see things that you probably didn't notice before. So here I go with the questions, for posterity:

1.  Do you like the company of the other person?
2.  Is the individual personally attractive to you? Do you feel inclined to apologize for appearance, manners, ideas, conversation, language?
3.  How do you make up after a quarrel or difference?
4.  As you look back over the relationship from the beginning, how has it changed?
5.  Do you have common interests? Did you have these interests before you met? Or did you become interested in the other persons interests?
6.  Has enough time passed to tell if it is true love or infatuation?
7.  Is anything more than physical attraction present?
8.  Do you love the individual as a person or do you like merely your feelings about him/her? Are you in love with the personality or "in love with love"?
9.  Does the person "wear well" with your friends?
10.  Are you attracted to the person for what he/she is or for what he/she can give you or do for you?
11.  Over what matters and how frequently do you have conflict? Is the conflict open or supressed? Is it superficial or fundamental?
12.  Are you willing to make concessions, or do you always expect the other person to do the pleasing, agreeing, and adjusting?
13.  Do you have any doubts about your love?
14.  How do you weather a crisis together?
15.  Is yours a case in which a strong physical attraction tends to draw you toward the other person, while an intelligent appraisal of personality makes you resist the physical appeal?
16.  Do you feel that, if you let yourself go and loved the other person as much as you might, you would become submerged in his/her personalityand lose your individuality?
17.  Are you sufficient stimulus for each other when you are together, or do you require external stimuli to prevent boredom?
18.  In your mind, how does the person compare to others? Are you constantly looking for "greener pastures"?
19.  What is the relationship between your enthusiasm and the presence or absence of the other person?
20.  Do you forgive, tolerate, accept, overlook, or resent faults and shortcomings? Do you love the person faults and all, or are you holding yourself in check pending reform?
21.  Do you see the other persons faults and their significance? Or do you merely see faults in a distant, detached way without realizing what those faults would mean in marriage?
22.  How much do you think of the other persons welfare and happiness?
23.  Is there anything or anybody in life that you consider more valuableto you than this other person or that you love more than you love him/her? If so, what or who is it and what does this fact mean to you?
24.  Do you have a desire to escape an unhappy home, school, or work situation?
25.  What has been your reaction to these questions? Have you found it difficult to be honest with yourself? Have you rationalized any of your answers?
Some more questions followed these, titled "QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER BEFORE MARRIAGE". Some of them do not seem very Bible focused, but whatever.

1.  Can I accept his/her faults and shortcomings?
2.  Can I visualize and accept him/her in the various roles he/she must play during our marriage (i.e., father/mother, sweetheart, provider, companion, lover, etc...)
3.  Would I be willing to give up things to provide things that would be important to the satisfaction of his/her needs?
4.  Is there the tender feeling that comes from knowing that he/she is on your side and is interested in satisfying your needs?
5.  Is there a feeling of solid and enduring friendship?
6.  Is he/she sexually attractive to me?
7.  Do we enjoy many of the same things, and share similar or compatible goals?
8.  Do I feel comfortable when I am in the company of his/her family and friends?
9.  Do I like who I am, or the way I feel about myself when I am with him/her?
10.  Has our courtship been relatively smooth and enjoyable?
11.  Are his/her personal hygienic standards similar to, or compatible with mine?
12.  Am I willing to accept the responsibility, as far as is reasonable, for making the relationship work?
So that's it. Those are the questions. Some of them might hit home pretty hard to those of you who are infatuated with someone, some of those questions seem pretty arbitrary though... Anyway, I mostly wrote this down so I could have a digital copy of it. So...........
