I am at school. I have to pee. I am almost finished with finals, I finished trigonometry this morning and I am pretty sure I did real well, I just hope all my plus'es and minus'es were in the right place... Also, BIOLOGY FINALS TONIGHT!!!!!!!11111111 (All those 1's are to make sure that, as if a dozen exclamation points were not enough, you understand my excitement) I am very glad to be done with this class now, I will be lucky to pull off a B, which really just makes me mad. MAD MAD MAD! I should be getting an A or a B+, but I have issues with secular styled teaching. I will divulge myself later.

Also, I got my motorcycle going the other day, I hope to be able to ride it to Omaha for Mother's day! I will post a picture of it sometime soon, not having a camera seriously limits me in this regard. I have a plastic gas tank sitting on the frame right now while I tune it up, the real tank just needs to be washed out and it's ready. Also, there is no headlight assembly. But I took it for a little spin on some pavement and it really kicks you back in the seat if you push it! Woop woop! There are some little things here and there that I need to tighten down, but it should be ready in time (so long as the paperwork passes inspection).

Anyway, I have to go finish studying and hope I can get a B in this class. Later on I will write something "real" or "important" or something similar.
