I got back from Omaha with no problems, right now I am at school getting ready for a test (I think) in my biology class. This biology class is the most ridiculous class I have taken except for that English one I took with some teacher who talked about how well written the communist manifesto was, and how he took showers - sometimes hot, but sometimes cold. No joke, they ask all these silly questions about cellular life and whatnot, I ought to know these, but they don't really teach you anything. I mean, I have learned more in the 30 minutes reading a different book than I have this entire school year in that class.

Anyway, I don't think I will have time to finish up the new layout tonight, so probably tomorrow night it will be up. I have to go to this silly class now, ciao.
