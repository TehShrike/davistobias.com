Sitting at this table
watching you smile and talk,
you always  compose yourself
with such precision,
no strand of hair misplaced.

Is  that your friend?
She talks much more than you
and you sit so  silent.
But in your mind you wander
a distance farther
than the  space between you and I.

That friend of yours has left
and  now you sit in silence
(both mouth and eyes strangely still)
Later  the friend returns and you smile,
it makes me wonder what
was  going on inside your head.

I say hello, you say hello,
we  smile and nod and say goodbye.
You will never tell me,
and I am  afraid to ask,
whats on your heart
and inside of your mind
that  is always reflected into your eyes.
