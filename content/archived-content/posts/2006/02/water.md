The pipes are thawed and the water is flowing, like golden beams of sunlight, falling on the evening sky. Truly this is magnificent! I went back to my trailer and heard much water flowing, anxiously looking to see if my bathroom flooded, I found no drop of water outside the sink. Or outside the pipes either, which means they didn't burst. Praise the Lord of heaven and earth!
