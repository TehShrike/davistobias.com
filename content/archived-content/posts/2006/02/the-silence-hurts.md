Do you ever hurt inside and you can't stand the silence? You know, those times when maybe something in your past cries out to be heard, something in the past is pushing and fighting it's way to the surface needing to be heard and felt. But maybe, just maybe, you're not ready to let that thought be heard, not ready to let that emotion touch you. So you turn the music a little louder. Turn it up a bit more until it drives all those other thoughts from your mind, and then when people come by and wonder why the music is so loud, you can't really answer can you? Because if you told them it's because you are still running in your mind, if you said you were afraid and terrified inside to face whatever is hiding, they wouldn't understand. So you turn the music a bit louder, louder, louder...

This happens to me consistently.
