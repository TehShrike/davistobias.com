Short bursts,
like words,
bits of poetry,
of how it was,
how  it really was.

So many lies,
for so many years,
I even  believe them,
lies I've told myself
enough to be convinced.

How  do I find it,
that truth behind my lies
except through the ones  behind them.

I could go on a freefall
through terrains  uncharted, unknown.
Past distant memories and a blurry past,
on  into what looks now like a dream.
And what will I find when I arrive?

If  truth be found and revived once more,
it is even through sorrow and  tears I would travel.
