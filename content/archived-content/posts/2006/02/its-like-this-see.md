I feel obliged to say something about this day, being the day of forced romance, but I don't feel so bad knowing I would have said something anyway. So here we go:

Valentine's day is crazy man, let me tell you something: I went to Wal-Mart (that miserable place) and what did I see but that 80 percent of the people were men. Surprised? You should be, since I heard that around 80 percent of all Valentine's day cards are mailed by women. I have this thought, see, and I think I'm in the money on this one. Women like to let other people know what they are feeling (in a very general sense) so I think Valentine's day is an excuse to let their friends know they are thought of and loved (not in a romantic way usually). But a guy isn't worried whether a guy knows what he's feeling (again, in a general sense) so Valentine's day is just a day where you do something special for that girlfriend/spouse/etc.

Take that whole paragraph however you want, I was just thinking out loud.

Another thing I noticed is that single people get engry about today. I don't. I really don't care a whole lot. No, seriously! I see a lot of hearts and stuffed bears and the like, but I don't get thinking about "Poor me, I'm so single and lonely, boo-hoo." I think one reason I don't really care about Valentine's day is because I don't like the concept a whole lot. It seems forced. It seems almost worse than Christmas, it's just so commercialized and no one cares that it is. No one cares that it's overly commercialized.

But anyway, I really don't care about Valentine's day. But if I were married, I would probably still do something special, make my own card at least, and cook a special dinner or something. That's it. Later...
