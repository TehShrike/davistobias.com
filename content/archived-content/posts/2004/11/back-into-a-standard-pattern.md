So I have not posted in a good while, hopefully I will get back into the swing of things here pretty quick. I don't remember exactly what happened since I last posted, but what I can recall is this:

I slowly rose from a dream like a morning sunrise, or an evening sunset which, though beautiful, lasts but for an instant.

So what happened is I got a job, got an apartment, and got high-speed internet again. That was about a month ago, but who's counting? So I got really side-tracked and busy, researching things and thinking deep, dark, heavy thoughts about relations and spirituality and my Savior. I got a little side-tracked in there somewhere, but I managed to escape with my life and most of my 'soul'. And by soul I mean that thing which encompasses the emotions, the mind, and etcetera.

I am building a metal melting... thingy... a foundry. Yeah, it's a foundry. So I am building this, it melts aluminum, bronze, copper, gold, silver, etc.. It uses an iron pipe as the crucible, so I probably cant melt iron. Yet. That's my next step. So this should be near completion in a few days, definitely by the end of next week.

I am also trying to make a sort of 'hot-box' for heating metal bars to make swords, knives, and so on. The whole idea of making swords is so crazy go nuts! I am imagining a whole line of 'Sane One custom signature' blades, custom made and really amazing stuff! So I have to make a mental note to not over-extend myself, because now I am pondering the nearly infinite possibilities and thinking of quitting my job to start a venture... Pace yourself brain, don't over-extend.

I hope soon to have a running computer of my own which will allow me to update this more often, I am also going to do some research into php coding real quick, maybe I can switch over.

I have a lot of thoughts going on in my mind, maybe I can find time to say something about them. Time presses around me, so I am leaving now.
