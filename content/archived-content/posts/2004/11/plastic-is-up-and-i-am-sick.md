Thursday night I ate some very tasty soup, it was a vegetable minestrone with some beef tortellini and Italian sausage. After I ate it, and after I started getting an extreme headache and feeling feverish I remembered my allergy to something in the Italian sausage. So I drank some medicinal tea and went to sleep pretty early (22:30) and when I awoke at 6:00 I felt pretty good.

Friday I worked most of the day and felt worse and worse until I finally went home an hour early with the runs. I drank some tea and sat around and then a friend of mine showed up and we hung out until about 22:00, after which I took a shower and promptly vomited into the toilet. We are talking ballistic style vomiting, something upwards of 50 p.s.i type stuff, stuff so pressurized that it hurt. After that I felt a lot better, and went to bed.

So now it's Saturday and I am feeling all right, a little weak but alright, and I finally put most of the plastic up around the house. I think I have said about a dozen times that I would, and so I finally did. It took me a good four hours I bet, but it looks pretty good I would say. I will find out soon enough how much help it was.

Also, I cast the forge a few nights ago, put the stuff in place and put it together. I still have to edit all the pictures and put the info together so you can see it, don't worry I will get that done soon. It looks pretty good, and it went together well, except that I didn't have quite enough cement mix so I will have to put something together or something. It will be okay, you'll see when I put the pictures up.

Anyway, that's whats up. Let me know if you read this, I like to know how many visitors I have.
