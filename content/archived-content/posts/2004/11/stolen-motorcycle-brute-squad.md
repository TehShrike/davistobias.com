So the other night, I cant remember which since I am so tired, my motorcycle got stolen! Yes, I had a beautiful 1972 Honda 175 Scrambler which was my joy to ride in all sorts of weather. I was still riding it in 12F degrees with a 70mph airspeed, boy that was chilly. But somebody in my neighborhood stole it, I am thinking of starting a vigilante squad because many stereo's have been stolen, and a couple people have had their cars attempted to be hot-wired.

I have created the burner assembly for my forge, it puts out a beautiful blue flame of 6 inches long (or so), I have the pictures but they are so immense that storing them on this site ate all my bandwidth for a day. So tomorrow I will put them up, along with updated progress on it, I should be finishing construction of it tomorrow. Then all that's left is waiting for the concrete to cure, which takes about 4 days, and getting a crucible. I might buy one online if the cost is cheap enough.

The apartment in which I reside is draftier than... a drafty thing... so tomorrow I am also installing plastic on windows, caulking other things, and using that great gift from God to man: Expanding foam!

Yes, that foam-in-a-can stuff works charming, spray it anywhere and it fills all the cracks.

Well, it's off to bed for me, I just failed to install SuSe Linux on my computer, the disc didn't come with any packages, not even the kernel! I am going to try Gentoo in the morning though, I am in the process of downloading it now.
