I finished my math final exam, I thought it was on Wednesday so I didn't study yet. I showed up at class and the teacher handed me the final's and I almost had a heart attack. But I glanced at it and realized I probably knew it all, so I took it and passed. Hooray! Class is over for me with a 4.0 GPA!

So now I am working full time, washing semi-trucks and trailers, and getting paid a decent sum. But it will all end, Lord willing, when I start class again full time. I hope I can afford it, class that is.

Not much else to say right now.
