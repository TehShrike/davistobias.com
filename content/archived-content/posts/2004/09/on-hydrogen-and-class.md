So this ol' web-site is coming along smoothly, despite what my wrists are trying to say. I don't really know if anyone has even read these, I mean I didn't let anyone else know I started this back up again. Also, I am a little busy to look at the free stats, so I wouldn't be able to tell.

I am in an accelerated algebra class, and it is going pretty slow so far. I took the first test, hoping to pass all of them on the first try so I don't have to take the final. Math to me is pretty easy stuff, it's just memorizing a bunch of rules and I use them everyday anyway, so it's cool.

In class the other day we talked about Kurt Vonnegut, he wrote "Slaughterhouse Five", "Breakfast of Champions", and many more. One of my favorite books is "Slaughterhouse", I also think it should be required reading. I finally got the books list started, but it severely needs updating since the last entry was Fabruary this year I think.

Since moving back from Maranatha, I have put most of my things into storage to keep the mice and bugs out. I really really want to get my own place, but I need a job first! Augh! I think I might go apply at McDonalds next week if no one calls me back. I am going to apply at some more stores tomorrow, maybe throw an app. at some other restaurants... This is kind of depressing.

I added a piece in the "Data" section about hydrogen production, it's math and chemistry intensive with no plans included. I hope to get the working plans up in a day or two.

Anyway, it's about midnight and I should try and establish a normal sleeping pattern so I can get up earlier to go job-hunting.
