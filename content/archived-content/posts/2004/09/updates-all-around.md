Hooray! I just put up the first invention. It's a pretty good plan for multi-cell hydrogen production made from PVC tubing. I am pretty sure it's complete, but let me know if I should change the format of it.

I applied for 3 jobs yesterday, some roofing, some cleaning, and some job cleaning 18-wheelers. I would even get to drive those big things, trailer and all! It pays pretty good, it's close to school, and the people there were real pleasant, so I hope I get it.

We have "Shoutfest" at my parents church today, which includes a decent line up, I guess, but the only band I would really like to see is Skillet. My family bought a "Family Pass", so I might hitch in with them.

I am working on a small "essay" on prayer, I might be done tomorrow. I think a lot about prayer, and how differently people approach the whole thing, I mean you've got laying on hands, and healing prayer, and public written prayer, and on and on. I am writing some of my own thoughts on the matter, so stay tuned.
