I am here, at my parents house, listening to TFK: Thousand Foot Krutch. Classic good stuff here.

Sorry about the lack of updates, this whole gig is still a work in progress, I haven't set it into my schedule yet. Incidentally, my schedule suddenly became very packed on Monday when I got a job with "Universe Company", a trucking company that deals with refrigerated stuff only. No, I'm not a driver, it could be worse: I clean the trucks and trailers. They are not cow haulers, those guys are right across the street though. So I use some high pressure water and soft brushes and so on, and clean them and then spray some liquid wax on the trucks.

Yeah. It's real exciting.

Anyway, that goes from 7:00 till 17:00 with one half hour lunch and two ten minute breaks. But, on Tuesday and Thursday I have class from 14:00 to 17:00 so I get off then. I really am running out of time, I have to organize my time a bit better. I get up at 6:00 to get to work on time, so I try to get to bed around 22:00 but it ends up being around 23:00.

Yesterday I had a mishap on the motorcycle, I was going home from a friends house and the chain popped off the rear sprocket. With some help from this girl (I didn't even get her name, sorry) I loosened the tier and put the chain back on. I tightened it all down but not even 3 feet away the chain popped off again. So I woke up my parents (I love them) at 23:30 and they came out and we picked up that thing and put it in our van.

I took it apart today and found some serious gashes in the left shock, some unimportant piece of metal got chunked off near the front sprocket, the rear sprocket got gashed up pretty ugly but it's still usable. But the chain now has this nasty kinky twist in it.

Anyway, that's the latest news from the home front. I got my first check today, it was okay. I think in a couple weeks I will have enough cash to get an apartment.
