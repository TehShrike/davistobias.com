Yo. So this here is my first post. Mostly I have been having a difficult time finding a job, but I still have some chump change left until that disappears. I started school a couple days ago: "Accelerated Beginners Algebra." This class is pretty slow right now, just a refresher course, but I am guessing that once we get into the last sections of the book it will pick up pace. Either that or slow down because nobody gets it...

I am really wishing I could get a job so I can move out of my parents house. Mostly I want a solid internet connection, but I also want a place to unpack my kitchen things from my former living quarters at Maranatha Bible Camp. So far I have applied at a couple grocery stores and a few restaurants and UPS, but UPS gets about 50 applicants per job opening so I don't have much hope for that one.

Anyway, I am actually still in the process of patching this code generated by Micro-opoly Frontpage, so I am going to run.
