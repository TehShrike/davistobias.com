On prayer:
I have been pondering prayer a bit, what with SYATP (See You At The Pole) going on a while back. Jesus warns us to not be like the Pharisees who prayed loudly on the street corners to show how spiritual they were, Jesus says to go into the most inner closet in the house and pray in secret. So I always thought -because of this- that prayer was a private, secret thing, quite different than outward, public prayer in SYATP. But then again, I have prayed with other people and had as deep and meaningful conversations with the Father than if I was by myself.

The passage this section comes from is in Matthew 6, so I finally was able to put it into proper context. Jesus is talking about hypocrisy in practicing righteousness, in this category He includes giving and prayer. Jesus draws a few parallels, the Pharisees who show off their prayers with loud voices and the secret prayer, the proud giver who trumpets the giving to everyone and the secret giving.

I don't think Jesus is saying to be righteous only in private, I think He was saying that the Father sees and knows what is in secret, the Father knows the motives and Jesus says to keep the giving a secret that only you and the Father know about. I am reminded of several persons I know who seem to be righteous and holy, but when they give or pray it seems to only be for show. Although I would not attempt to judge the motives, it certainly seems to me that these are the people Jesus is talking to when He says to give and pray in secret.

I was reminded by a close friend that people obviously knew that Daniel was praying, thus the reason for his entrapment and attempted burnination. But his praying was done in his house, not in the public to demonstrate his holiness.

This reminds me of humility. If you go around saying how humble you are, your humility is rather lacking.

That's about it for now.
