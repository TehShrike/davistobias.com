I got more pictures up of the forge. I also turned it on the other day, had some small problems with the burner but it's okay. I still think that it doesn't get enough flow to make a quick burn, it will probably work but it might take a good half hour to melt aluminum. Whatever, I will work on it more tomorrow.

Washing trucks and trailers in 10F weather is not fun, especially when the wind regularly blows at 30mph to give a wind chill factor of: WAY TOO COLD!!! All I know is yesterday I was literally chilled to the bone, left wondering how the peoples up north could CHOOSE to live this cold. I suppose it's different when you are not soaked with water standing in that chill, but whatever. Today was not nearly so bad, I was expecting it and it was also about 15 degrees warmer.

Did I mention I like Chinese style food? I could easily, easily, easily eat it for every meal, every day, for the rest of my life.

School registration is really worrying me, it's too late for financial aid this semester and I don't think I will be able to come up with enough money. I might be able to take just one class again, which is better than nothing...

I am updating more often, anyone notice? Hooray. Gotta run, I am weary and sleepy.
