Some basic web-site revisions I am going to try to make are the addition of some writings, poems, essays, etc. of mine and some friends. Oh yes, believe it or not, I have done, and still do (although not quite so much now) a whole lot of writing. I have written many many poems, many essays on things ranging all over the universe and so on. But what is it if I don't deliver? Just bragging I suppose. So first off I will add some writings from a good friend of mine, some poetry, some prose, whatever you want to call it, these are hand selected by me from his extraordinary collection.

I hereby must also link to his website, a work in progress at the time: [http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84](http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84)

I have many writings I am working on, although since I am working on each of them at an equal rate, I have not made a whole lot of progress yet. Which brings me to another web-design possible change: I am thinking about only updating twice a week, giving me more time for research and projects. Let me know what you think: Do you enjoy the semi-regular updates? Would you rather have better content at twice monthly, or perhaps once a month?

I am really thinking of the once a month, this would give me time to better write out the projects section, also it would be better, fuller content. If you have objections, let me know.

For a trip back in history:

<span style="color: blue;">cyber_scapes</span> was originally founded as an email and business venture for the company (still in existence): Cyber Scapes Limited. This was probably around 1997-1998.

The first web-site was published late in 1998 and was originally a Conspiracy Theory ring, I posted many entries on things most theorists speculate. I still maintain that almost all of them were true. I attempted to use secure methods of posting and so on, but whatever.

The Conspiracy Theory maintained for several years, ending around 2001-early 2002\. During this time the web-site looked pretty horrible, but I was a newbie to web-design and thought that rotating gifs, huge images, and background music was cool. Actually I never did the background sound, but everything else I did. I probably changed the entire scheme of the web-site about 20 times.

The next phase this web-site went through was as an information holding storage, I did have plenty of information: Images, documents, some sounds, schematics, etc.. And I organized it alright I guess, but I did not know much for coding and so it took forever to do, it also looked pretty random although by this time I had realized more of the basic design principals of the web. (For design principals go <del>here</del> or the <del>cached</del>)

Finally I decided on this very minimalist style, I don't have any reason to change it for a long while. If you are not the kind of person to sort through the design, just e-mail me and I will send you a template of it. It is extremely modifiable.
