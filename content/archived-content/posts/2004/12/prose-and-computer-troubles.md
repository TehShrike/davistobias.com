So here it is Monday again, start of a new week of slaving away, working for "The Man". And I wish I was unemployed with a wealthy person giving me lots of money.

I added some personal 'poetry' to the extra section. I am not sure if I should have done this or not, I don't really like to let people see my stuff, it is a side of me I usually try to hide. Full of pathos and self pity and what-not...

I have been working with Linux for a good while now, I am recently trying to install Red Hat 8 on one of my MANY computers, but I think the motherboard is toast. Whenever I boot up from a CD it only reads the CD as bootable perhaps 20 percent of the time, the rest it ignores it. Then, if I am using the cd for anything and it pauses to let the processor catch up, it needs to start up the drive again but it can't. I was able to get into the de-bug dump and stuff and it tries to reset the CD drive and goes into a loop.

Thankfully I have multiple computers, and one of them might actually be faster so tonight I might give it a shot. I need to shave and clean up first...

The forge stalled for a little while until I can figure out a solution to the burner problem. When I light up the burner it puts out a great blue flame, but when I put the burner inside the barrel it is only orange, although I did manage to fix that problem. My brother read in a book about an electric fired forge, I will check that book out of the library probably tomorrow and see whats up.

My boss today told me he was thinking about having me get my CDL license so I could drive some of their trucks around town, that would be good because then if I quit I have something to carry with me. I am real good on a forklift, but I don't have any sort of certification yet, so I can't really put that on my resume.

Well, I might add a Linux section to this site soon, but right now I really have to use the bathroom and shower and everything, so I'm out.
