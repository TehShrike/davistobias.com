Projects, yes yes, so many projects. Where should I begin? Those who know me are probably not surprised when I say I have a tendency to take on too many projects. Let me list the ones I can remember: The Foundry, Rebuilding a Soda Machine, Repairing a studio size piano, shared-processing server stack, hydrogen production unit, and a few other small ones I can't remember right now.

On top of that, I am working on some 'essays' on health and electric drives, writing some music, producing a short film, etc.. Also, lately I have been doing some deep philosophizing about life, music, communication, love, and so on. All while trying to work 9.5 hour days and still do several hours of research every day.

Of course all this means that I cannot devote enough time to any one project to finish it quickly. But I am improving on this aspect, I thought about ten dozen more projects but quickly dropped them because I realized I wouldn't have time to work on them.

So here is the latest news: We might be moving out of this wonderful apartment into one with separate rooms for each person, lots more space, a decent furnace and a/c, and still in the area! I am pretty pumped about this, and everyone here is also pretty excited. If we did this, we would probably move in a couple months I would guess, but we still have no confirmation.

All this really means to my projects is that a couple (the piano, the soda machine) I need to finish quickly so I can have them ready to move into the new place. I should have a general schedule ready after Christmas is over.
