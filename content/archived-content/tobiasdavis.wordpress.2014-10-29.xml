		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yo. So this here is my first post. Mostly I have been having a difficult time finding a job, but I still have some chump change left until that disappears. I started school a couple days ago: "Accelerated Beginners Algebra." This class is pretty slow right now, just a refresher course, but I am guessing that once we get into the last sections of the book it will pick up pace. Either that or slow down because nobody gets it...

I am really wishing I could get a job so I can move out of my parents house. Mostly I want a solid internet connection, but I also want a place to unpack my kitchen things from my former living quarters at Maranatha Bible Camp. So far I have applied at a couple grocery stores and a few restaurants and UPS, but UPS gets about 50 applicants per job opening so I don't have much hope for that one.

Anyway, I am actually still in the process of patching this code generated by Micro-opoly Frontpage, so I am going to run.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this ol' web-site is coming along smoothly, despite what my wrists are trying to say. I don't really know if anyone has even read these, I mean I didn't let anyone else know I started this back up again. Also, I am a little busy to look at the free stats, so I wouldn't be able to tell.

I am in an accelerated algebra class, and it is going pretty slow so far. I took the first test, hoping to pass all of them on the first try so I don't have to take the final. Math to me is pretty easy stuff, it's just memorizing a bunch of rules and I use them everyday anyway, so it's cool.

In class the other day we talked about Kurt Vonnegut, he wrote "Slaughterhouse Five", "Breakfast of Champions", and many more. One of my favorite books is "Slaughterhouse", I also think it should be required reading. I finally got the books list started, but it severely needs updating since the last entry was Fabruary this year I think.

Since moving back from Maranatha, I have put most of my things into storage to keep the mice and bugs out. I really really want to get my own place, but I need a job first! Augh! I think I might go apply at McDonalds next week if no one calls me back. I am going to apply at some more stores tomorrow, maybe throw an app. at some other restaurants... This is kind of depressing.

I added a piece in the "Data" section about hydrogen production, it's math and chemistry intensive with no plans included. I hope to get the working plans up in a day or two.

Anyway, it's about midnight and I should try and establish a normal sleeping pattern so I can get up earlier to go job-hunting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hooray! I just put up the first invention. It's a pretty good plan for multi-cell hydrogen production made from PVC tubing. I am pretty sure it's complete, but let me know if I should change the format of it.

I applied for 3 jobs yesterday, some roofing, some cleaning, and some job cleaning 18-wheelers. I would even get to drive those big things, trailer and all! It pays pretty good, it's close to school, and the people there were real pleasant, so I hope I get it.

We have "Shoutfest" at my parents church today, which includes a decent line up, I guess, but the only band I would really like to see is Skillet. My family bought a "Family Pass", so I might hitch in with them.

I am working on a small "essay" on prayer, I might be done tomorrow. I think a lot about prayer, and how differently people approach the whole thing, I mean you've got laying on hands, and healing prayer, and public written prayer, and on and on. I am writing some of my own thoughts on the matter, so stay tuned.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am here, at my parents house, listening to TFK: Thousand Foot Krutch. Classic good stuff here.

Sorry about the lack of updates, this whole gig is still a work in progress, I haven't set it into my schedule yet. Incidentally, my schedule suddenly became very packed on Monday when I got a job with "Universe Company", a trucking company that deals with refrigerated stuff only. No, I'm not a driver, it could be worse: I clean the trucks and trailers. They are not cow haulers, those guys are right across the street though. So I use some high pressure water and soft brushes and so on, and clean them and then spray some liquid wax on the trucks.

Yeah. It's real exciting.

Anyway, that goes from 7:00 till 17:00 with one half hour lunch and two ten minute breaks. But, on Tuesday and Thursday I have class from 14:00 to 17:00 so I get off then. I really am running out of time, I have to organize my time a bit better. I get up at 6:00 to get to work on time, so I try to get to bed around 22:00 but it ends up being around 23:00.

Yesterday I had a mishap on the motorcycle, I was going home from a friends house and the chain popped off the rear sprocket. With some help from this girl (I didn't even get her name, sorry) I loosened the tier and put the chain back on. I tightened it all down but not even 3 feet away the chain popped off again. So I woke up my parents (I love them) at 23:30 and they came out and we picked up that thing and put it in our van.

I took it apart today and found some serious gashes in the left shock, some unimportant piece of metal got chunked off near the front sprocket, the rear sprocket got gashed up pretty ugly but it's still usable. But the chain now has this nasty kinky twist in it.

Anyway, that's the latest news from the home front. I got my first check today, it was okay. I think in a couple weeks I will have enough cash to get an apartment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have been feeling pretty political lately, that is, lately I have been feeling the need to express my intense frustration towards any American government.

So how about that Patriot Act hey? So many people tell me they don't care because they "don't have anything to hide", to which I have finally made up my made to say something along the lines of "Screw you". We as Americans have a DUTY to keep the power of the government in CHECK, this means that at any moment when the government moves to take ultimate power from the people we are REQUIRED to oppose it.

I am quite upset about this, you might be able to tell that. But, since the Patriot act puts me in danger for knowledge. Knowledge of things like this: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Document, 35 kb</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have decided to reveal something to you all which I have been stewing on a long time. I didn't really want to speak my mind online, but I decided it is the broadest medium available and so on... So, here I am, revealing myself in a very personal way:

I have struggles with understanding things, with memory of subjects, with memories in general. But there is a time in my life that is now a far distant memory, it keeps me awake late into the night, a stirring inside my heart for something I left in the past. These memories I will speak of now, in full honesty and openness, but I don't remember when they happened or in what order they happened. So the following are fragmented memories of mine, they are not written in any order of time or importance:

One time in my life I had a party, a party celebrating my tenth birthday. It was in a church, a church with red brick walls and a white painted roof, inside the basement was a large area for gathering and inside the kitchen in the basement was a stairway which seemed mysterious to me and led outside. In one of the rooms was a chimney flue from the furnace, it had a small pot-iron door on it and I used to sneak away and look inside it. One day I looked inside and found a dead bird; It had flew into the chimney and couldn't get back out so it died. The church was huge, it had large wooden rafters and a stage where we performed and recorded some music, just some of our family and a friend played the cello. I remember sneaking around one afternoon and finding crowns and robes stored away in a cupboard, they were for a play for Christmas. The pastor was a nice man, he talked about things I didn't understand, but sometimes I listened and payed attention because he knew the truth. One day people started yelling at each other in the church, I don't know what about, a few weeks after that everyone from that church had left and never came back. I remember standing in the back of the church, looking around and realizing that we would never return and all my friends I had made would disappear. One of them didn't.

At another time and another church, my family went there. My oldest sister got married in this church, it was one of the happier days of my life. This church had a white ceiling and dark brown heavy rafters, its pews were a blue color I think, there was a man who used to sit in back and run the sound system. I remember a time when there was no pastor, but an older man came in and preached, then we found another pastor. I remember the main door was in the basement, then there were some stairs that led to the sanctuary. There was a big open area, but sometimes I would help roll out some walls which had words tacked to them, or posters. This church I remember more than the first one, it was not quite so long ago. There was a girl there with the most beautiful eyes who I used to torment with my childish affections, I think I loved her in a selfish way. But that passed after a while and she later got married, I even got to go to the wedding. One day I left for a while to a camp with lots of cedar trees to wash dishes and clean things during the summer, then I called my Mom and found out that there was arguing in the church, people were fighting and calling each other bad things and yelling at each other. When I heard this, my heart was broken in despair because I loved the people in this church, every one of them. I broke down and wept in the arms of a man I barely knew, he also disappeared. Later, my family left the church and so did many other friends, I never got to see anyone for a while because when I went back home after the summer everyone had already left. I still love those people, but I don't know how to tell them anymore.

One other time I met this girl in a youth group we had at the second church, she was beautiful and quiet. She once gave me a ring made of duct-tape and said she would marry me. I believed her because I had fallen in love and wanted it to be true. Maybe it was true because she invited me to be her date at her schools prom, I remember she wore a red dress and had a smile which I didn't understand. I wanted to tell her how beautiful she was, I don't think it came out right. Later that night I refused to dance with her, I don't know what I told her, but I was afraid. Afraid that I would be a fool and embarrass her even more, afraid that I would stumble and sin because I was a weak man, barely a man at all. And I did other things I am ashamed of, but I can't remember them all very well. The last thing I remember is that I told the biggest lie I have ever told, I said I only loved her as a sister. But another thing I remember is me acting the fool and embarrassing her, so I don't know what was going on. But I remember one thing, that I one moment realized that I had let walk past me the woman I loved and she would never return. I'm sorry for my lies, I'm sorry for being such a child.

I remember another time, in the very far past, a giant house we used to live in with solid oak doors and a back porch big enough to run around on. The front porch had extra wide steps and we used to sit on them and watch the cars go by. My Dad had a shop in the garage where he worked on old furniture, antiques, and whittled strange things. I remember there was a wood burning stove, I think it is called a Franklin stove, that stood away from the wall and had little designs on it and a funny little top piece that decorated it but it's bottom peg was broken so it ended up skewed sideways all the time. I used to go out into the shop and stand there, looking at the stove and watching my Dad work on the strange machines that were inside of pianos. One time, not so long ago, I was eating breakfast with my Dad and talked a little bit about the old house and the old times and how I wished we could go back to them. It was one of a few rare times I saw my Dad get real quiet and sad, with that look that was looking at you and reaching back into time all at once. He had a very tired voice, sad and almost crying when he said "So do I son, so do I." And then he told me that he didn't want to talk much about those times.

If I try real hard, I can remember two people from even further in the past: The woman I first loved, and her father. I was only a child then, I don't imagine more than 8, but my memory often deceives me. My family and this family were very close friends, this girl and I were the closest. I remember sometimes in flashes of memory that we were best friends, I told her everything and she told me everything. I remember that her Dad had an electric wheelchair and he had to drive it everywhere because he couldn't walk. But he was one of the coolest people that I know, him and my Dad were real good friends also. One day I came over to their house, and this girls girl-friends were there and she picked on me and I didn't understand. But not many weeks after that, her Dad died and I remember another family got up and left the service because of the music was too rocky. Soon after that, her Mom got married to another man and I remember at the wedding that this girl who was once my closest friend started crying and yelling, but I couldn't understand why. Then later, she went really crazy and they had to take her away and that was the last I ever heard. It's hard when I best friend dies, but when a best friend just disappears...

There are many memories in my mind, all of them revolve around one thing: People I used to know and love, disappearing into the past and fading like a shadow. If I return to the people I used to know, will they let me heal, can I be forgiven also? If I meet these people, what will I say? I know what I would tell one of them, one special person who disappeared ages ago.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night I had a very peculiar dream, it was intensely realistic although during the dream I knew it was a dream. So I guess it was like taking part in a movie I was watching, or a bit of theatre or something. Anyway, it was a very nice dream, a bit disconcerting at first, but nice.

It took place in Omaha, in places that I somehow knew from when I was much younger but I can't quite place them now. The part that I really remember was when Nathan (my brother) and Esther Walker and I went to Esther's house. The strangest thing about it was that the house was the same house that I grew up in: My Grandpa's house. The only thing that went on was that all three of us went inside and Esther and I were talking about some different soups that she was making. They were all those thin, watery kind of soups that have some chicken broth base or similar, I can't remember what they are called. Anyway, we talked about that and we talked about other things also, but it all seemed like just two good friends hanging out: No romantic tension, no intimacy that would suggest a relationship, only one thing that would suggest it: Nathan was off doing something else, like the "tag-along" does on a date. You know what I mean, not really getting involved in any of the conversation or anything. It was kind of nice to be real casual with a girl.

It really got me thinking though. If I really do find myself attracted to a girl, I don't want to start a relationship without God's blessing on it. I remember how William and Sara first met, it was very casual. I think, however, that if you start any relationship with the opposite sex, it will always have a hint of the possibility of a relationship. For instance, let us say I wanted to be better friends with Esther Walker. For what reason? But just as soon as I did, it would have the possibility of a lasting relationship. It's true that you can start a relationship with a member of the opposite sex and have it not develop into intimacy, but it needs to be developed that way from the start and there are certain things you will never be able to talk about--sort of. I think at times that I worry too much about these things, maybe it's true, but I don't want to be the kind of guy that dates a thousand women. I don't want to decieve a woman by acting in one way and meaning something else. I also don't want to get to the point of starting an intimate relationship and the girl thinks "What the heck!?!" because she never saw it coming. Or maybe that would be a good thing? I know this comes naturally to some guys, but I struggle with it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Suicide: A Killer is Stalking the Land (David Wilkerson)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Main thesis is found on page 29 and following: Suicide is an unpardonable sin. He does so with these seven "proofs":
<ol>
	<li>suicide is a form of atheism</li>
	<li>it is satanic seduction</li>
	<li>it is sin of hypocrisy</li>
	<li>it is sin of pride</li>
	<li>it is sin of lying</li>
	<li>it is an attack on the body of Christ</li>
	<li>it is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost: "The Bible says our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. To destroy that temple is blasphemy." That is his major argument, no additional proofs given</li>
</ol>
pgÂ  85 "Job's real victory was conquering himself."

Wilkerson is obviously an Armenian, where he is convinced that Job "saved himself", not in some figurative sense, but he says clearly on pg 86 that "Job did four simple things, all on his own ... he believed in God"

But Wilkerson doesn't see (even though he just as well states it explicitly) that Job did not turn to God until <em>God</em> revealed Himself. Wilkerson even says "there was not one sign..." on pg 88, but he doesn't see the obvious sign: God spoke to Job, face to face! Surely that is a sign!

Wilkerson's "cure" is as absurd as his statement that Job didn't see a sign: Buy grapes, visualize them on the vine, pretend you are cured of depression, etc. All of these (pg 98) are silly, and don't address the heart of the issue at all.

pg 100 "all loneliness is a result of having strayed from His presence." (see Psalm 16:11) But then he goes on to say that "even Jesus gets lonely!" But how can Jesus stray from God's presence? And later: "I am convinced that His greatest need is to have a one-to-one personal communication with those He left here on earth." W, says that God has a <em>need</em>. This is the same idea that C___ W___ has, that God <em>needs</em> to talk to us, that's why He made us.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A song I am writing, the first one.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am working on a handful of songs for an album and this is the first one. The album "thought line" is from this, the beginning: A man who lost his heart to a woman. I would like to see how this would sound if translated into another language.

(I sent this to Laci Conour, who speaks Spanish pretty well apparently. She's translating it herself or using the Google translation, whatever. The message I wrote to her is at the end.)

<strong>English:</strong>

This is how it begins,
another heart carried away
by unrehearsed melodies.

Sounds pass by my ears and enter
straight into my heart,
the song of all time.
And you, my love, are the one
who carried this soul.

"This is how it begins" is a
shower of rain, covering the sun.
Lightning crashes, and
I am swept away by the downpour.

This is how it begins, another heart lost to
simple music, but that music
captured me.

<strong>Spanish (Google translation):</strong>

AsÃ­ es como empieza,
otro corazÃ³n arrebatado
por melodÃ­as improvisado.

Los sonidos pasan por mis oÃ­dos y entrar en
directamente a mi corazÃ³n,
la canciÃ³n de todos los tiempos.
Y tÃº, mi amor, eres el Ãºnico
que llevaron a esta alma.

"AsÃ­ es como empieza" es una
ducha de lluvia, cubriendo el sol.
Rayo accidentes, y
Soy arrastrado por la lluvia.

AsÃ­ es como empieza, otro corazÃ³n perdido
mÃºsica sencilla, pero la mÃºsica que
me capturaron.

-----

This is the message I wrote to Laci Conour:

Hey Laci, thanks for helping me with this!

I wrote this song as the first piece of music to an album I'll be working on over the summer, and I would like to sing it in Spanish. I can speak the language pretty well, and I can pick out a handful of words if I'm reading it, but I don't know it well enough to trust the Google automatic translation :-)

I'll write the English version, followed by an explanation which will hopefully help make sure the translation is similar in feel, then I'll copy in the Google auto translation, in case you want to work off that.

-----
The Beginning:
<english version>
-----

So obviously the song seems like a love song at first, but my intent isn't the sort of love song that one would sing to the significant other, but more of an an introduction to a longer story (the album).

My deep passion for music is reflected in the lyrics: In the first paragraph I wanted to create a parallel between the emotional reaction that music creates and the emotional bonding between a man and woman who "fall in love". (That term is cliche, but helps explain the idea)

The second set is more abstract, but basically expounds on the first idea. The "my love" is a person in past tense, but the singer is calling the woman to mind for the audience, as though she were there at the moment, so it should probably be present tense. This breaks the sentence "And you ... this soul", since it is a past tense sentence but the "my love" is present. I did that on purpose, hopefully it can be reflected in the Spanish but it's not critical that it does.

The third paragraph is probably pretty clear, it's just saying that it started as something simple "a shower of rain" but turned into something much bigger, the "downpour".

Finally, drawing a parallel back to music: It's not always the complex musical themes that pull at the heart the most. Sometimes it's the simple tunes, that have haunting melodies.

That's it. Don't worry too much, in music things get abstracted so it's not a super big a deal, and I can fiddle with it to get the rhythm correct, I just want someone who actually speaks the language to make sure it translates well.

Thanks for doing this, it means a lot to me. I'll be sure to let you know when the song is done/recorded. :-)

Here's the translation that Google generated with it's auto-translator, I don't know if it will help or not:

El Comienzo:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Proverbs 15</h1>
I have been thinking about how the use of swearing has become more and more prevalent, and among the other reasons it shouldn't be used comes Proverbs 15:4 "A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit." Words have a lot of power, it says here and elsewhere, and perverseness of words breaks a person down. I was thinking of C____, who allows dirtiness to creep in sometimes--not with swearing, but with very negative thoughts which are also unwholesome--and that really demonstrates this verse. But then I, knowing this truth, take part in or do the same, and so bring condemnation on myself. Lord help me to remember to use my words as a "tree of life"!
<h1>Psalm 16</h1>
The theme seems to me to be "rejoicing in Gods wisdom, given to me". David reminds us of our need for God in vs 2 "my goodness is nothing apart from You", and reminds us of Gods grace and compassion in vs 9-10 "therefore my heart is glad ... You will not leave my soul in Sheol". The joy I get from just <em>knowing</em> God and being in his presence should be a real "fullness", as it says in vs 11.
<h1>Psalm 17</h1>
This was a strange one for me to read--David says things like "You have tried me and found nothing". Does he really mean that he is sinless? It seems that when David asks God to strike down the wicked, that he also talks about how pure he is. What a strange thing, I do not yet understand it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Homosexuality and Relationships: David and Jonathon</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For quite some time I've had this thought in my mind, and recently my pastor spoke on the topic of relationships, which made me think even harder about this, and so now I am writing about it.

There is a lot of discussion within Christian circles about various aspects of homosexuality, but I find that most discussions involve the "gay agenda" and other similarly loaded phrases.

This bit of writing doesn't deal with any politics. Instead, I want to draw your attention to something a little deeper beneath the surface, something a little less comfortable to talk about: Male to male relationships. Intimate ones.

Let's start by looking back in the Bible, all the way back into the Samuel books, where we read this:
<blockquote>Now it came about when <em>[David]</em> had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his fatherâ€™s house. (1 Samuel 18:1-2)</blockquote>
So basically Jonathan sees David and does this love at first sight routine. They became really good friends over time, and the relationship was very intimate. So intimate that when Jonathan died, David wrote a pretty heavy song about it:
<blockquote>How I weep for you, my brother Jonathan! Oh, how much I loved you! And your love for me was deep, deeper than the love of women! (2 Samuel 1:26)</blockquote>
A relationship "deeper than the love of women" is, I would say, pretty deep.

There is a movement that tries to say this relationship was homosexual â€” that Jonathan and David were homosexuals.Why is this the case? Is this immediate thought wrong? Specifically, why is it that people take a story about two guys who love each other deeply, and think of it as something sexual? Some people will say that they are "living in sin" and trying to "justify their sinful ways", but I don't think that's a very helpful approach.

I have a question, but I don't care about the answer so much as what goes on in the back of your mind as you answer it: Two men deeply love each other. Is sex involved?

The very nature of your response tells me about the state of mind you have: If you have an unhealthy view of relationships, you will take the part about "love" and jump to something about "sex". This state of mind is something people make jokes about, and very few people realize that the mindset is a prison. By equating relational intimacy with physical intimacy, we shut the door to true relational intimacy.

Active homosexuals struggle with this lack of relational intimacy, and it leads to high depression and suicide rates among those who practice it. But it's not just the active homosexuals, it is anyone that has an unhealthy view of sexuality. Every encounter with intimacy invokes sexuality in the mind, and puts off the true intimacy that could have been. That's why my "two men" question leads some people to consider the relationship as sexual or inappropriate.

Many guys tell me they aren't comfortable with male-on-male relational intimacy, but I think most of that discomfort is either because of their personal sexual sins, usually pornography.

But we should seek to be truly intimate with other Christians, and man to man, in <strong>true purity</strong>. If we don't pursue this, we are missing out on one of God's gifts, that of man to man intimacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Intro: Things are looking questionable. Historically, things happen over a short period of time, so you won't be likely to be able to afford stocking up <em>enough </em>once things get bad.

What to do: Sensible, staged acquisition of necessities. Things that you will actually use. If things don't get bad, you either eat a lot of beans or donate to charity (they may only accept certain specs, so plan ahead).

The important things: Shelter, water, food, transportation, electricity.

Shelter: Housing could be a problem if you can't afford rent, for example. Look for someone you could move in with maybe. If things go all Louisiana you might want to get out of the city.

Water: Water from the city may get intermittently shut off, and if you have a well you might not have electricity. Store some if you depend on the city. Get a manual pump or generator etc. if you use a well (also store some is handy if well breaks, consider a cistern).

Food: Classic foods (beans, rice, etc.) are good, but don't want to get boring, so make sure to stack away some fancier things. Food may go bad, schedule food overturn so you can either use it before it goes bad, or donate it to some pantry if you can't eat it all.

Transportation: You want at least enough fuel to get out of town. Cars versus SUVs etcetera. If you live in town a bicycle is a good idea. Use stabilizers in the fuel, still need to schedule periodic overturn.

Electricity: This is almost unneeded, but things like freezers come to mind. Cell phones, mp3 players, laptops, something to watch a movie on, they are all helpful to ease the boredom if stuck in the city (may not be able to go out for walks in the park, etc.). Many approaches: If it's just for the freezer, a small generator run intermittently may be good enough. Battery packs extend the time between generator running. Solar panels give electricity without fuel, so that may be another tool.]]></content:encoded>

Would you rather sit at a booth, or at an open seat?

I'm going to make a huge assumption here, one which I'll explain later on, but I think most people would rather sit at a booth than an open seat.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These weeds and corruptions fill
and no longer does the soil,
riven with cracks from
rain flowing as tears,
hold good things. And yet,
a grove of trees
bearing fruit only a while
is yet loved in the winter.
Small hearts make small promises,
but one is a seed
from which grows a tree,
but perhaps only with tenderness. 
Strong and supple, but not yet,
for now is a seed only
and a promise only.
The soil is healed
with seeds of grass,
medicine stitching together
what was deeply broken.
Some day, sunlight
creeps in slowly,
darkness fades,
and morning brings tears of joy.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>2012 Presidential election prediction</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/?p=1198</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov -0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know you don't care about the upcoming election, but I thought I'd let you know who is going to be in charge of the federal executive branch the next cycle.

Let's start with some observations:

The Republican party has, for many years, become increasingly liberal in almost every way. This is true from smaller local elections, all the way to the presidential elections.

However, the people in the Republican partyÂ are still generally conservative in their approach, and the people still care about a few select issues. This is why, when John McCain (a very liberal person) was nominated for the Republican party, a great number of Republicans either stayed home, or wrote in some third party on the ticket, giving Obama the necessary extra margin.

The increasingly liberal character of the Republican party is also why the Tea Party group has so much support, because there is no mainstream party that even remotely satisfies the more strict conservative. The Tea Party people I know (a very small sample size, admittedly) are Republicans who still register as Republicans, still vote for Republicans, but want the Republican party to stop furthering the liberal policies. That is to say, if the Republican party were to become more conservative (not even hard-line, necessarily) almost all the Tea Party people I know wouldÂ leave the Tea Party.

Democrats will generally vote for the Democrat presidential nominee, independent of who that nominee is, whereas Republicans will generally vote for someone with perceived character, meaning the Republican party has a higher likelihood of a split vote. Because of this, it is important to find a Republican candidate who will be able to unite the middle-roadÂ Republican, as well as the more hard-line/old-school Republican, who are large enough in number to matter.

Let's look at the current Republican presidential candidates (list taken from <a href="http://www.thepresidentialcandidates.us/">here</a>, anyoneÂ above 1%):
<ul>
	<li>Newt Gingrich</li>
	<li>Ron Paul</li>
	<li>Mitt Romney</li>
	<li>Michele Bachmann</li>
	<li>Rick Perry</li>
	<li>Rick Santorum</li>
	<li>Jon Huntsman</li>
	<li>Gary Johnson</li>
</ul>
The question isn't "who on this list is most conservative", but rather "who on this list can unite the Republican party". And so far I'm not feeling a whole lot of confidence to say that any one of them can. For example, suppose Newt Gingrich wins the Republican nomination. Do you think that the growing number of hard-line conservatives will support Gingrich? I really don't think so.

One person who will satisfy the hard-line conservative crowd is Ron Paul, but, while I am a big Ron Paul fan, I am not sure if the moderate Republicans would vote for him. Although, if he <em>was</em> nominated, the moderates mightÂ vote for Paul just to beat Obama.

The problem is that the Republican party is <em>extremely divided</em>, and since it doesn't take that many points to change the general election, I predict that the Democrats will win, pretty much exactly like last presidential election, when the Republican party nominated John McCain, who they later.

The only thing that might be a game changer is the Democrats response to Obama: much of his rhetoric prior to election was to "bring home the troops", among other cool things, and he clearly did not live up to his promise. Because of this, many Democrats I talk to might be willing to vote for someone moderately Republican, if that person clearly supports ending the war. This is pure conjecture however.

What to take away, if you are a Republican:

It's not electability that matters. If you want a Republican as president, you need someone to unite the currently-divided Republican party. Remember, the strict conservatives have no qualms about voting third party.

My personal thoughts:

I'm a strict/old-school conservative and Christian, so I will vote third party before I vote for the "lesser of two evils". Even though he has some shadowy political past, I think Herman Cain might have had a chance of uniting the Republican party, but I can't think of anyone else who would unite the party enough to secure the outcome. That's why I say it will beÂ four more years of Obama.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Beards: Societies push for sexual neutrality.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fair warning: This should not come as a surprise, given the title, but this post will be discussing a topic that some may not find "suitable for children".

Our current culture is obsessed with the sexual.

This is not news, of course, I just want to draw out the point first.

Look at advertisements, look at popular online videos, look at theater films, ask the internet what a large chunk of it's traffic is used by (hint: pornography). Sex sells, is the catch phrase, and this topic has been the subject of many books, and quite a few songs. One of my faorite bands says "sex is currency, she sells cars, she sells magazines".

In fact, at the university I find that sex is such a popular topic that the school's opinion paper ran, at least for a while, a "sex column".

And in this larger discussion about sexuality, the concept of "freedom" is brought up, usually in the sense of "I should be free to do what I want". An additional concept, and the one I am actually getting to, is that of "being who you are". For example, the GLBTA community often justifies their sexual behaviour by saying they were "born this way".

Which brings me to the topic at hand: Beards.

There is a severe inconsistency in our culture that justifies abberrant and controllable behaviour, behaviour which has yet to be proven genetically related, and yet essentially disallows beards.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On prayer:
I have been pondering prayer a bit, what with SYATP (See You At The Pole) going on a while back. Jesus warns us to not be like the Pharisees who prayed loudly on the street corners to show how spiritual they were, Jesus says to go into the most inner closet in the house and pray in secret. So I always thought -because of this- that prayer was a private, secret thing, quite different than outward, public prayer in SYATP. But then again, I have prayed with other people and had as deep and meaningful conversations with the Father than if I was by myself.

The passage this section comes from is in Matthew 6, so I finally was able to put it into proper context. Jesus is talking about hypocrisy in practicing righteousness, in this category He includes giving and prayer. Jesus draws a few parallels, the Pharisees who show off their prayers with loud voices and the secret prayer, the proud giver who trumpets the giving to everyone and the secret giving.

I don't think Jesus is saying to be righteous only in private, I think He was saying that the Father sees and knows what is in secret, the Father knows the motives and Jesus says to keep the giving a secret that only you and the Father know about. I am reminded of several persons I know who seem to be righteous and holy, but when they give or pray it seems to only be for show. Although I would not attempt to judge the motives, it certainly seems to me that these are the people Jesus is talking to when He says to give and pray in secret.

I was reminded by a close friend that people obviously knew that Daniel was praying, thus the reason for his entrapment and attempted burnination. But his praying was done in his house, not in the public to demonstrate his holiness.

This reminds me of humility. If you go around saying how humble you are, your humility is rather lacking.

That's about it for now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have not posted in a good while, hopefully I will get back into the swing of things here pretty quick. I don't remember exactly what happened since I last posted, but what I can recall is this:

I slowly rose from a dream like a morning sunrise, or an evening sunset which, though beautiful, lasts but for an instant.

So what happened is I got a job, got an apartment, and got high-speed internet again. That was about a month ago, but who's counting? So I got really side-tracked and busy, researching things and thinking deep, dark, heavy thoughts about relations and spirituality and my Savior. I got a little side-tracked in there somewhere, but I managed to escape with my life and most of my 'soul'. And by soul I mean that thing which encompasses the emotions, the mind, and etcetera.

I am building a metal melting... thingy... a foundry. Yeah, it's a foundry. So I am building this, it melts aluminum, bronze, copper, gold, silver, etc.. It uses an iron pipe as the crucible, so I probably cant melt iron. Yet. That's my next step. So this should be near completion in a few days, definitely by the end of next week.

I am also trying to make a sort of 'hot-box' for heating metal bars to make swords, knives, and so on. The whole idea of making swords is so crazy go nuts! I am imagining a whole line of 'Sane One custom signature' blades, custom made and really amazing stuff! So I have to make a mental note to not over-extend myself, because now I am pondering the nearly infinite possibilities and thinking of quitting my job to start a venture... Pace yourself brain, don't over-extend.

I hope soon to have a running computer of my own which will allow me to update this more often, I am also going to do some research into php coding real quick, maybe I can switch over.

I have a lot of thoughts going on in my mind, maybe I can find time to say something about them. Time presses around me, so I am leaving now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the other night, I cant remember which since I am so tired, my motorcycle got stolen! Yes, I had a beautiful 1972 Honda 175 Scrambler which was my joy to ride in all sorts of weather. I was still riding it in 12F degrees with a 70mph airspeed, boy that was chilly. But somebody in my neighborhood stole it, I am thinking of starting a vigilante squad because many stereo's have been stolen, and a couple people have had their cars attempted to be hot-wired.

I have created the burner assembly for my forge, it puts out a beautiful blue flame of 6 inches long (or so), I have the pictures but they are so immense that storing them on this site ate all my bandwidth for a day. So tomorrow I will put them up, along with updated progress on it, I should be finishing construction of it tomorrow. Then all that's left is waiting for the concrete to cure, which takes about 4 days, and getting a crucible. I might buy one online if the cost is cheap enough.

The apartment in which I reside is draftier than... a drafty thing... so tomorrow I am also installing plastic on windows, caulking other things, and using that great gift from God to man: Expanding foam!

Yes, that foam-in-a-can stuff works charming, spray it anywhere and it fills all the cracks.

Well, it's off to bed for me, I just failed to install SuSe Linux on my computer, the disc didn't come with any packages, not even the kernel! I am going to try Gentoo in the morning though, I am in the process of downloading it now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finished my math final exam, I thought it was on Wednesday so I didn't study yet. I showed up at class and the teacher handed me the final's and I almost had a heart attack. But I glanced at it and realized I probably knew it all, so I took it and passed. Hooray! Class is over for me with a 4.0 GPA!

So now I am working full time, washing semi-trucks and trailers, and getting paid a decent sum. But it will all end, Lord willing, when I start class again full time. I hope I can afford it, class that is.

Not much else to say right now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thursday night I ate some very tasty soup, it was a vegetable minestrone with some beef tortellini and Italian sausage. After I ate it, and after I started getting an extreme headache and feeling feverish I remembered my allergy to something in the Italian sausage. So I drank some medicinal tea and went to sleep pretty early (22:30) and when I awoke at 6:00 I felt pretty good.

Friday I worked most of the day and felt worse and worse until I finally went home an hour early with the runs. I drank some tea and sat around and then a friend of mine showed up and we hung out until about 22:00, after which I took a shower and promptly vomited into the toilet. We are talking ballistic style vomiting, something upwards of 50 p.s.i type stuff, stuff so pressurized that it hurt. After that I felt a lot better, and went to bed.

So now it's Saturday and I am feeling all right, a little weak but alright, and I finally put most of the plastic up around the house. I think I have said about a dozen times that I would, and so I finally did. It took me a good four hours I bet, but it looks pretty good I would say. I will find out soon enough how much help it was.

Also, I cast the forge a few nights ago, put the stuff in place and put it together. I still have to edit all the pictures and put the info together so you can see it, don't worry I will get that done soon. It looks pretty good, and it went together well, except that I didn't have quite enough cement mix so I will have to put something together or something. It will be okay, you'll see when I put the pictures up.

Anyway, that's whats up. Let me know if you read this, I like to know how many visitors I have.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got more pictures up of the forge. I also turned it on the other day, had some small problems with the burner but it's okay. I still think that it doesn't get enough flow to make a quick burn, it will probably work but it might take a good half hour to melt aluminum. Whatever, I will work on it more tomorrow.

Washing trucks and trailers in 10F weather is not fun, especially when the wind regularly blows at 30mph to give a wind chill factor of: WAY TOO COLD!!! All I know is yesterday I was literally chilled to the bone, left wondering how the peoples up north could CHOOSE to live this cold. I suppose it's different when you are not soaked with water standing in that chill, but whatever. Today was not nearly so bad, I was expecting it and it was also about 15 degrees warmer.

Did I mention I like Chinese style food? I could easily, easily, easily eat it for every meal, every day, for the rest of my life.

School registration is really worrying me, it's too late for financial aid this semester and I don't think I will be able to come up with enough money. I might be able to take just one class again, which is better than nothing...

I am updating more often, anyone notice? Hooray. Gotta run, I am weary and sleepy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here it is Monday again, start of a new week of slaving away, working for "The Man". And I wish I was unemployed with a wealthy person giving me lots of money.

I added some personal 'poetry' to the extra section. I am not sure if I should have done this or not, I don't really like to let people see my stuff, it is a side of me I usually try to hide. Full of pathos and self pity and what-not...

I have been working with Linux for a good while now, I am recently trying to install Red Hat 8 on one of my MANY computers, but I think the motherboard is toast. Whenever I boot up from a CD it only reads the CD as bootable perhaps 20 percent of the time, the rest it ignores it. Then, if I am using the cd for anything and it pauses to let the processor catch up, it needs to start up the drive again but it can't. I was able to get into the de-bug dump and stuff and it tries to reset the CD drive and goes into a loop.

Thankfully I have multiple computers, and one of them might actually be faster so tonight I might give it a shot. I need to shave and clean up first...

The forge stalled for a little while until I can figure out a solution to the burner problem. When I light up the burner it puts out a great blue flame, but when I put the burner inside the barrel it is only orange, although I did manage to fix that problem. My brother read in a book about an electric fired forge, I will check that book out of the library probably tomorrow and see whats up.

My boss today told me he was thinking about having me get my CDL license so I could drive some of their trucks around town, that would be good because then if I quit I have something to carry with me. I am real good on a forklift, but I don't have any sort of certification yet, so I can't really put that on my resume.

Well, I might add a Linux section to this site soon, but right now I really have to use the bathroom and shower and everything, so I'm out.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple days ago I was borrowing my roommates video camera, a nice little thing, and I went to downtown, snuck up some parking tower to the top (fourth) floor and recorded some traffic. Then I went to the Old Market area to record "life", I got some good clips of people walking in crowds, some horse carriage shots, and some other stuff. Here's where the fun starts:

This kid walks up and immediately starts talking to me (I am going to try to get a written transcript or audio) about some random stuff, chairs, goth kids and whatnot. He has this big cloak on and is dressed all Renaissance style, and I am thinking to myself: This man is really strange, but I like strange people. So we talk about preppy dressed people, we talk about goth kids hanging out downtown, and then he mentions something about his soul being 78,000 years old. Yep. You got that right, seventy eight thousand years old.

Of course he says stuff about hypnosis, past life regressions, and so on. I thought this would be a fun conversation, so I recorded it, with his knowledge of course. So some of my favorite highlights were when he told me that he was now a vampire, he adapted so apparently he doesn't have to drink blood, but he wants to anyway. He knows the master/prince of Omaha who gave him his dirty thoughts, he also knows of the prince of St. Louis who "owns strip clubs and stuff" and plays role-playing games as a vampire.

Anyway, I will get those transcripts or audio on here real soon so you can all laugh with me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some basic web-site revisions I am going to try to make are the addition of some writings, poems, essays, etc. of mine and some friends. Oh yes, believe it or not, I have done, and still do (although not quite so much now) a whole lot of writing. I have written many many poems, many essays on things ranging all over the universe and so on. But what is it if I don't deliver? Just bragging I suppose. So first off I will add some writings from a good friend of mine, some poetry, some prose, whatever you want to call it, these are hand selected by me from his extraordinary collection.

I hereby must also link to his website, a work in progress at the time: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84">http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84</a>

I have many writings I am working on, although since I am working on each of them at an equal rate, I have not made a whole lot of progress yet. Which brings me to another web-design possible change: I am thinking about only updating twice a week, giving me more time for research and projects. Let me know what you think: Do you enjoy the semi-regular updates? Would you rather have better content at twice monthly, or perhaps once a month?

I am really thinking of the once a month, this would give me time to better write out the projects section, also it would be better, fuller content. If you have objections, let me know.

For a trip back in history:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: blue;">cyber_scapes</span> was originally founded as an email and business venture for the company (still in existence): Cyber Scapes Limited. This was probably around 1997-1998.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The first web-site was published late in 1998 and was originally a Conspiracy Theory ring, I posted many entries on things most theorists speculate. I still maintain that almost all of them were true. I attempted to use secure methods of posting and so on, but whatever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Conspiracy Theory maintained for several years, ending around 2001-early 2002. During this time the web-site looked pretty horrible, but I was a newbie to web-design and thought that rotating gifs, huge images, and background music was cool. Actually I never did the background sound, but everything else I did. I probably changed the entire scheme of the web-site about 20 times.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The next phase this web-site went through was as an information holding storage, I did have plenty of information: Images, documents, some sounds, schematics, etc.. And I organized it alright I guess, but I did not know much for coding and so it took forever to do, it also looked pretty random although by this time I had realized more of the basic design principals of the web. (For design principals go <del>here</del> or the <del>cached</del>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally I decided on this very minimalist style, I don't have any reason to change it for a long while. If you are not the kind of person to sort through the design, just e-mail me and I will send you a template of it. It is extremely modifiable.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Projects, yes yes, so many projects. Where should I begin? Those who know me are probably not surprised when I say I have a tendency to take on too many projects. Let me list the ones I can remember: The Foundry, Rebuilding a Soda Machine, Repairing a studio size piano, shared-processing server stack, hydrogen production unit, and a few other small ones I can't remember right now.

On top of that, I am working on some 'essays' on health and electric drives, writing some music, producing a short film, etc.. Also, lately I have been doing some deep philosophizing about life, music, communication, love, and so on. All while trying to work 9.5 hour days and still do several hours of research every day.

Of course all this means that I cannot devote enough time to any one project to finish it quickly. But I am improving on this aspect, I thought about ten dozen more projects but quickly dropped them because I realized I wouldn't have time to work on them.

So here is the latest news: We might be moving out of this wonderful apartment into one with separate rooms for each person, lots more space, a decent furnace and a/c, and still in the area! I am pretty pumped about this, and everyone here is also pretty excited. If we did this, we would probably move in a couple months I would guess, but we still have no confirmation.

All this really means to my projects is that a couple (the piano, the soda machine) I need to finish quickly so I can have them ready to move into the new place. I should have a general schedule ready after Christmas is over.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here it is, the first post in a month. Unfortunately I have nothing glamorous to post, no new writings yet, no more pictures except this one: Click here. I have not been working on any projects yet, except cleaning and organizing my stuff. I emptied out my storage unit because I was tired of paying money for stuff I didn't use, then at the same time, my parents decided to clean the basement to put in a new furnace so they gave me all my stuff I had forgotten about. So now I have piles of stuff, even piles in my car, because I have not had time to sort through them (or desire) and things in my car are still there because I ran out of room.

I am right now recording some stuff from my friend Willaim's collection, improv, composed, etc.. I am putting together a piece and am rifling through some of his works to find interesting bits. I feel compelled to post his web-site address, it is in better shape now: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84">http://www.geocities.com/rubidium84</a> He has some of his poetry up, some other stuff, but still in it's beginning stages. If I were not recording, I would be finishing the "vampire transcript" which I have been promising, I continue to promise: It is not to be missed! Amusing to the nth degree.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Unfortunately I am already tired, so this is not going to be very big (yeah right).

The Barracks is closing down, somewhere around early May. I am once again heading out to camp Maranatha for the summer, and everybody else is scattering.

In computer news, I had a hell of a time trying to get a server hosted using the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Server</a> (apache.org), I could open it using my computer, but no one else on our private network could open it. Puff (my roomate and fellow techie) and I worked on the firewall for a good many hours, and I worked on my setup for many days, but still no luck.

More computer news: I sorted through all my hardware, all floppy(4) and cd(6) drives, hard drives(16), modems(5), sound cards(6), network cards(23), old controller cards(3), drive/inner cables(38), power cords(10), motherboards(8), built computers(12), and ram. The numbers are how many I have, the ram is mostly the older 30-pin, and some 72-pin, I think about half of it is bad but I have no way to test them yet.

Last news of computers: I installed <a href="http://damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> (damnsmalllinux.org) on my secondary hard drive (hdb) and then tried to dual boot it, but <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO.html">lilo</a> (the boot loader) installed on my secondary hard drive, making the system boot to win98. Cutting through the technical jargon, I tried something stupid and forgot to back up my files before hand, do that nice list of computer parts is now gone. Arrgh!

In other news, I am almost near riding stage with my new (to me at least) motorcycle, I had to buy a new battery for it and now I am real strapped for cash. I got my papers in late for work, so I don't get paid till April 25th, albeit, a very large paycheck. The cleaning of the office space is almost done, giving me time to work on projects again. The one I want to finish soon is the <a href="http://geocities.com/cyber_scapes/invent/invent2.htm">forge</a> although I decided to try electric heat instead of gas because its cleaner and I am having no luck with the burner. Did I mention cheaper to assemble?

In Philosophy, I have been discussing presumptions, assumptions, belief vs. knowledge, etc.. I am still pondering these things, so let me just mumble for a bit: If you have a belief, how do you distinguish between belief and knowledge? I mean, many people believe things like: The earth is flat, the sun revolves around the earth, etc.. But what validation of a belief is acceptable? What reason do you have to say whether the earth is flat or round? Because all science is mere assumptions of understanding of data, where all repeated experiments are still perception of data. Especially with the findings of advanced physics and quantum mechanics, that even observing something can change it's properties. Of course this rule is mostly for atomic equations, but the concept still stands.

So what is acceptable justification (Travis, read the definition <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=justify">here</a>) for a belief? I am still pondering that. For me, I have knowledge of the truth of the Bible, not through validation by evidence, I have no justification for this knowledge, so does that make it a belief? I don't think so, at least according to the definition of the terms.

Anyway, I need to sleep, I think I am back in a routine, so look forward to frequent updates.

But specifically this one <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=14">here</a>.

So sleepy, I am making this short. My bro and I are constructing the hydrogen making device, it is really coming along well and I will add pictures and update the <a href="http://geocities.com/cyber_scapes/invent/invent1.htm">plans</a> with my notes and real pictures as soon as it's done.

Okay, I go to deactivate my existence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here I am at camp, I don't even know how long I have been here. Perhaps a month? A couple months? A few short weeks? A year? I shall forget this thought before I go insane. Again.

I will write a brief history of my life at <a href="http://www.maranathacamp.org/">Maranatha Bible Camp</a>:

I arrived sometime in May I think... Moving on... I thought my job would be to take over the kitchen managing position, for this I was quite nervous as I have had no experience in the "office work" side of managing. Nevertheless, I started well by organizing and cleaning the office to make it much nicer.

A while later a lady named Pam got hired and so she runs the more office side of the thing, while I run the kitchen and food making etc.. So things are working out pretty well, except for the lack of kitchen staff this summer. I have been putting in an average of 15 hours a day, 6 days a week. Pam has been putting in about the same amount, sometimes more I think.

So things are pretty dandy out here outside of the kitchen. All the staff went to Grand Island Waterparks yesterday and now I have the biggest sunburn I have ever had in my life! It is definately pretty painful, but I have not taken any medication for it. I wish I had some Aloe Vera leaves to apply on it, but I have some extract sunburn treatment stuff that's pretty good. I should be peeling by tomorrow night I think.

Speaking of burns: How about a temporary tattoo, where a negative is held a bit from the back and a focused UV light is placed behind it. Then, after about 15-20 minutes depending, you would have a high resolution images burned onto your back which would last a decent amount of time. And if you tanned, you could even have the image on your back for weeks or months! Booyah!

So I have to go already, but I brought my forge out to camp and am hoping to play with it a bit later.

<strong>No One Really Wins This Time</strong>
Welcome love, I have made a place for you here
And I know every word they say
I don't want it want to make you change

Change if you want, but don't you go and change for me
I can love you as you are
I didn't mean to make you want to leave

In the fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time

If you don't find a love you want
If I have acted ungracefully
I don't want to see you go
I never meant to make you want to leave

Go if you want
Make your way straight to the door
I hope that you'll look back before you go
Cause grace looks back before it starts to leave

In the fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time
In the endless fight of grace and pride
I don't want to win this time
I don't want to win this time

Change if you want, but don't you go and change for me
I will love you as you are
I didn't mean to make you want to leave

It's a fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time
In the endless fight of grace and pride
I don't want to win this time
I don't want to win this time
In the endless fight of grace and pride
I don't want to win this time

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What up my home dawgs?!?!

I am just kickin' it here, the power keeps flickering on and off and snow has piled up so I got my car stuck. Then, when the man in charge here and I went to chain pull it out, the chain must have snagged the transmission line because it is now dribbling tranny fluid. Whoop whoop!

A Simple List (Things That Are Recently Broken On My Car):
<ol>
	<li>Left Window</li>
	<li>Right Window</li>
	<li>Transmission (I don't know where yet)</li>
	<li>Heater Core</li>
	<li>Brakes (Just went out a couple days ago)</li>
	<li>Trunk Gasket is Blown</li>
	<li>Etc...</li>
</ol>
So, here I am at work, wishing I had a new car. A truck maybe? A four-wheeling slugger, we could be pals, are you out there Mr. Rightruck? (Cut to scenes of the truck and I, dancing through sunny meadows, on the old tire swing, drinking hot cocoa together by a warm fire, etc...)

So I have to go now, keep it real fo-shizzle!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There I go again, trying to think of something clever to say, nope. No dice. Can't do it. The proverbial tongue twister (The Sixth Shiek's Sick Sheep (insert crying here) shut up!) has crash landed on your "Title" and left you no escape. Blast!

The weather here is frightful, thankfully there are no fires inside, a mighty fine little blizzard just finished last night around 11 or so. The power never went off, the internet kept cutting out (you know how much we hate's that, my precioussss) but I made it through the night alright. The long, cold night ... insert allegory comparing the weather to my seat of emotions.

Cut to the chase: I am now stalling, writing a paper which is overdue, knowing I can't get into town on time because of the roads (that's pronounced row-ads, for those not "in the know") and wondering how I can make this whole blog post an allusion to space travel. Because I am infatuated with space travel.

Start slow majestic music now (envision fields of flowing wheat, the sun rising onto the mountains, etc...).

The same way that we procrastinate with our homework, we also procrastinate with our space program. Ladies, gentlemen, hermaphrodites: The time has come to discard NASA and push toward corporate scheming space flight! Now is the time! Now!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes I read other peoples blogs and wonder why they posted such things as:

<blockquote>So ru awak nw???!?!?!? Anywho holy monkeys! Lolololol whts the dillio. I wanna shout out to my homies: crizzinie, sho-dawg petey, and p-mother!!!!!!!!!</blockquote>

I have been thinking, why post if you don't have anything to say? I mean, at least let everybody know how your doing. And, no "rurofl1111111???!!!!!! shzdgl? gggggg!!!" is not a legitimate entry. The following is acceptable, although not mixed with classic humor or things which you could chuckle at (the following is true):

So today I went to pick some stuff up at a food bank, I went around a corner and spun out ending in a decent ditch. After the boys here pulled me out I realized I popped the bead off the tire (basically, it is flat and you can't just put air in it) so I put on the donut. Speaking of donuts, I once saw two guys fly past me at 90mph in a Ford Festiva with the front drive tire a donut! That's insane! As I continue to the food bank, I repair the tire at Wal-Mart (I am not a fan, but it was the only thing around) and since it would take 40 minutes for them to put it on, I grab the tire and do it myself. Except the jack is frozen. You might have a scissors jack for your car, if you do it would be wise to pull it out every couple months and tighten it up and down, lubricate it and put it back. So I used a forklift to lift the mini-van and changed the tire. Ingenuity! That's about it, it's a little late so I am going to sleep. Latah.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings fair ones. I just finished reading "The Fellowship of the Ring" once again. It seems to me that I read it once every few years, and thoroughly enjoy it each time. Although this time I came to the last page where Aragorn says "I don't know what part in this you played, Boromir, but follow those hobbits quick, there is strange work afoot!" And then they all run around trying to find Frodo, who slipped away to the boats. Then Sam says something like "Think Sam, your legs are no good so use your head." And runs down to the boats, sees one slipping into the water without anyone in it and... THATS IT!!!!!!!! The rest of the pages are missing! AUGH! How does it all end! Does Boromir find the hobbits? Do the hobbits get killed from the Orcs who are close by? Does the Nazgul or one of the Nine Black Riders come at them? Oh dear!

Then I decided that I would read through the Bible again, since it has been quite a while. Just before I read the "Fellowship" I read most of the Silmarillion, which is the complete history of middle earth, the Varda, Illuvitar, the Elves, etc... But it is written in a very "mysterious" tone. Rather, it uses an older style of English or something. Anyway, I started in Genesis and read about 20 chapters in one sitting. The Bible is really a captivating piece to read, especially where it says that man was created before the plants. What? But I digress.]]></content:encoded>

As to reading the bible, I also tend to read large chunks at once, and when I get into the New Testament I try to read Paul's letters in one sitting each. That's how letters are meant to be read.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Norsola.<br/>The series contains three books: The Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return of the King. They detail the travel of Frodo Baggins from his home through perilous journeys to a mountain called Khazadum where he throws in this ring of power. Thats the basic idea, of course there is no way I could say everything about the book within a short paragraph, it is quite lengthy and extremely well written I think.<br/><br/>There are two other books:<br/><br/>The Hobbit, which details how the ring came into possesion of Bilbo Baggins (godfather of Frodo) and his adventures. Also well written, but not nearly as difficult to read as the aforementioned trilogy. It should be read first or fourth.<br/><br/>The Silmarillion, which details the complete history of the universe from it's creation to the age of men. It is actually comprised of four smaller books of the same thing, imagine it as four different perspectives on the same events. It is also well written, and is very interesting if you are into fictional history or you want to learn more about middle-earth.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello once again to my mass of devoted followers, I have returned from my adventures to the Omaha region! This issue shall deal with one thing and one thing only: My adventure to the Netherworld of Omaha.

I departed in my desperately dilapidated vehicle, visions of burning and long hours on the road-side filled my mind as I merged onto the interstate of 80, however, I did have a rather uneventful journey. I began my sojourn at the house of my parents, I stayed ten nights exactly, on the evening of Friday. My brother, whose name is Nathan, was certainly a great help: He drove me around into the deepest corners and darkest allies of the city, even to assisting me in driving the demon of a Ford to the junkyard. While the transmission did slip quite frequently, the short journey to the parts-yard had no accidents.

After much party-ing (pronounced as two distinct words: party ing) and frolic-ing, I departed my temporary residence and returned with a generous man who provided a means of transport and free lunch! Whoop! He is also my boss, how awesome is that?

A couple things happened whilst I was "in the city", which are: A small plane crashed into a field, I never found out what caused it but I took a couple pictures. I took some pictures with a malfunctioning Canon F-1, some of them turned out nice, I will post some if I can scan them. My brother, whose name is Nathan, and I got some more work done on the Hydrogen Cell and I took some pictures with a digital camera, so I should be able to post them faster. I also was involved in a riotous debate on presidential voting, I will post my thoughts soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once, when I was not much younger than I am now, I thought that the greatest thing would be if I could face my greatest fear. I mean, I am deadly afraid of heights, but I don't let it control me. I am also deathly afraid of dark, enclosed spaces, but I can manage if I want to, it's not too big a deal. But, I thought, certainly there must be some fear that I have that I haven't overcome, maybe I am so afraid of it that I am afraid to even know what is is. Afraid of the fear?

Now, here I am, 22 in your linear time, and I think that was probably a silly thing to want. I think I know what I am afraid of, not that I would really want to tell you anyway, but it keeps shifting to something else.

Which brings me to another thing involving fear: I hear a lot that men are afraid of commitment, mostly this is said about men and relationships. I can safely say that is not true, at least for me and I think it's safe to assume for other men. It's not the commitment we are afraid of, it is the going to the point-of-no-return, it is that committing is like jumping off a cliff without a parachute. You just threw yourself out there, no strings, no safety net, nothing to fall back on except the hard, hard ground. Fear of falling?

Maybe I am afraid of falling, it's not the heights that bother me, it's the falling. Should I face the fear, and how?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[you could pick some deep boogers. And although I am not the first person to use "boogers" in as blog, I am sure I will be the first to reference the skill of guitar playing to booger picking. You see, whoever has the mad skills at guitar playing should be able to pick some really good boogers.

Now, for all those I just grossed out, or those who wonder if a strange metaphor is hidden within the preceding paragraph, pay heed: <a href="http://jerryc.tw/">Jerry C</a>, a cleverly ingenious guitar player, is very good at his guitar. So I just wonder if he could pick boogers real well. No silly metaphor or anything, just wondering.

Apparently, nose picking is considered a psychological oddity, or rather, those who pick their noses at regular intervals are seen as having psychological problems. Not that I put any stock in psychology, but if it's true, maybe guitar players with really skilled fingers will give birth to children with really skilled fingers who will develop strong desires to pick their noses. Maybe, just maybe, someone who cares about their children will forcefully repress their desire to pick boogers. FORCE YOUR CHILDREN!!!

In all seriousness, I vote to forcefully remove the television from children, video games and television are a number one concern for me. That is, children who are in a state of development should not be exposed to artificial realities like television and video games. Go outside and explore the world, climb a tree and see the world. See the world! Go look at the thousands of things within your own neighborhood, go watch the birds fly, go see how flies can fly.

Join with me today, say with me: Kill The TV!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Proper use of the etcetera</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2006/01/25/proper-use-of-the-etcetera/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On review, I notice that I use the word 'etcetera' a lot, of course in abbreviated form 'etc...' but certainly more than average. This brings me to a conclusion that I like the word, which in fact is true. For instance, if I am discussing birds, I can say something like "Whereas the pigeon is useful, carrying notes, etc..." In this sentence I am using the word 'etc...' in an assumption that you know what else pigeons are useful for. In general English, it is thought better to list a few things before claiming the etcetera, such as "Whereas the pigeon is useful, carrying notes, tasty eggs and meat, etc..." In this example I have listed three possible examples of what a pigeon is useful for, ending with the clause 'etc...' since I am sure pigeons must have more uses, but I can't be bothered to figure them out. I just assume that there are other commonly known things to which you can add 'etcetera'.

Another bold use of the etcetera is as a sentence completion, such as "All that glitters, etc..." It should be obvious that this usage should be restricted to common and well known phrases, using the etcetera as a sentence completion on unknown sentences can only lead to confusion. As in, "When did, etc..." This usage clearly lacks enough content to assume an ending to the sentence, also a sentence such as "All that, etc..." does not conclusively lead to the common statement "All that glitters is not gold." Certainly there are instances where such drastic use of 'etc...' would be acceptable, such as a paragraph that clearly stated a known phrase earlier could cite it again with "All that, etc..." and in context it could be understandable.

Perhaps you wish to expand your use of this word, even to database entry or some such thing. Given a sufficient data entry, an ending of 'etc...' could be used. Although this is generally frowned upon, if a sufficient sample of data is sufficient to assert a general data type, the etcetera could be used. In mathematics we learn that to plot a line, we need at least two points, in data sets we need a set large enough to display the average. Examine the following set of data, where we shall use the 'etc...': 001, 005, 003, etc... In this example it would be hard to understand what assumption is implied through the etcetera, sometimes context will make this more understandable, such as: "A set of three digits, average values are 001, 005, 003, etc..." Even this use of 'etc...' is a little brash, but is technically acceptable since several sets are given. To make the preceding set more understandable, a larger set would be helpful, such as "001, 003, 002, 001, 004, etc..." In this case the data is noticeably within a certain range and so is quite less confusing. Since the use of the etcetera in this case is to shorten a list of data, the sentence could be formed as "A set of three digits, values are 001-005, etc..." In this case, the understanding of the 'etc...' is resting completely on the preceding sentences.

Let's go one step further and use etcetera in the form y=mx+b, which is obviously a linear equation. Consider the equation where we use x={x&gt;0, x&lt;4}. If we let m to equal 1, we could say "Where x cannot equal 4,  etc... " to imply that all the preceding gibberish about a linear equation is pretty standard and everyone should already understand it and be able to plot several points easily. This last usage of etcetera is very rare to find, and is usually found in mathematics in the form of "it follows that", usually found between two equations where the connection is well known. Although the etcetera is the same concept, other terms have replaced it and made it's use looked down upon.

In closing, please treat the word with respect. However, make sure you use this word frequently, it is a great way to make communication less cumbersome. This last sentence I put here as a last example: The use of the 'etc...' is a great way to speed up conversation, etc...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got back from Omaha with no problems, right now I am at school getting ready for a test (I think) in my biology class. This biology class is the most ridiculous class I have taken except for that English one I took with some teacher who talked about how well written the communist manifesto was, and how he took showers - sometimes hot, but sometimes cold. No joke, they ask all these silly questions about cellular life and whatnot, I ought to know these, but they don't really teach you anything. I mean, I have learned more in the 30 minutes reading a different book than I have this entire school year in that class.

Anyway, I don't think I will have time to finish up the new layout tonight, so probably tomorrow night it will be up. I have to go to this silly class now, ciao.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here I am, sitting watching a woman who I know (but not very well), and she smiles and talks to her friend (I think it's her friend, or she's just friendly, which she is but I digress) but when silence happens (you know what I mean, that silence that comes about occasionally in conversation) I see something else. Watch her eyes and you can see what I see, maybe you can tell me what it is, a sort of sadness is in her eyes. Maybe it's my own heart reflected in her eyes (BAM! I just got personal!), but it seems to be a deep thoughtfulness, a stillness. It's not so much that I am attracted to the eyes that are lonely (it could be interpreted that she has "lonely" eyes, I don't really think they are) it's that I find myself deeply interested, concerned even, that she would ever feel quite so alone that her eyes are downcast in sadness. Alas! Is that even a tear I see? Just kidding about the tears. Most of this reminds me of a poem by Billy Collins "The First Dream", which the last line says "you might have gone down as the first person / to ever fall in love with the sadness of another." This poem needs to be read by everyone. To continue, I later said hello, she said hello, and then we both said we were fine and said goodbye, see you later, all that jazz. Nonsense! What's the deal with her anyway?!? Next time I see her I will make it a point to ask that difficult question, but then I become afraid that I am seeing thing's that aren't there. Because, look! Her friend returns and they start talking again, she smiles and laughs (crystal clear, healthy and playful) but is it still there in her eyes? Bah, I don't know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In response to the many letters saying "What are you up to these days?" I crafted this response:

I am at Maranatha Bible Camp. I am the Kitchen Manager. In response to the "So you took Ron's job?" question, the answer is, in a sense yes. I work here full-time but am considered volunteer, this is a support based ministry. Yes, I do like it here, and yes, I do get lonely at times. I am in school at Mid-Plains Community College, right now I am taking a trigonometry class and a biology class. I am planning on getting a degree in atomic physics, if the Lord wills it. No, Mid-Plains doesn't have that degree so I am planning on transferring to the University in Lincoln, I have noticed that God has different plans a lot of times, I wish I could see them better. I spend my days working in the kitchen here, doing some small bit of homework, and practicing archery. In my spare time I have been studying my favorite topics: Atomic physics and inter-dimensional perceptions, that is, this three dimensional illusion that we perceive.

I don't know what's going on, but lately it seems that God has been showing Himself to me, it is a bit frightening. I have been studying scripture, reading through the Bible before summer starts is one goal. Lately I have been noticing the war of the flesh more, that is, the war against fleshly desires, as Paul say, is raging on but I don't think I noticed quite so much before now. Paul said that he buffet's his body, that is, he brings his body into complete submission, I wish to be more like Paul. I have been watching the secular world around me and how it is slowly influencing Christianity, it is unfortunate and I think that to fight it people need to understand that it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a war and that the world <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> against God. Anyway, I have to go back to cooking.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Muslim fanatics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I guess most of you have heard of the incident where a Danish newspaper printed some cartoons depicting Muhammad and the entire Muslim community seems to be in a great rage about it? If not check it out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons">here</a> (Wikipedia) to get the details.

Basically, some newspaper printed a few comics, all ribbing the Muslim's Muhammad, and quite a big riot broke out. Muslim's throwing petrol bombs at UN buildings and such, protesting in the streets, people dead and injured, police injured (maybe some dead, I don't know), lethal weapons used by both the police and the Muslim fanatic groups. Although some protests have been peaceful, most have used anger and violence so far.

I have a couple questions:

What's the deal with the Muslim's protesting to other countries? It seems that if a Danish newspaper got on their nerves, they should protest the NEWSPAPER! Maybe if the newspaper didn't listen to them, they should protest the DANISH GOVERNMENT! Not all these other countries! What's the deal anyway? It seems that the Danish government is not listening (no surprise) so the Islamic community is going straight to the U.N. and demanding an imposed sanction. I suppose this is logical, start with the lowest, move up to the highest: Start with the newspaper, move up to the U.N. Now let's look farther ahead here, what if the U.N. doesn't listen (it probably won't(I hope it won't))? There is really no higher authority (except God Himself) so they will start protesting everywhere, making their cause known to the world. And if that fails? ...

What's the deal with religion anyway? That is to indirectly say, what's the deal with Christians anyway? And by this I mean as follows: Here it seems the Muslim's have found these cartoons derogatory to their faith and they are ready to protest right away. So then, look at the Christian's who have the very foundation of their faith mocked and derided daily, are there protests? Is there violent opposition? The answer is an educated no! Although some violence has occurred, it is not common. And protests are fairly common, but I don't know of a whole lot that turned violent.

So what's the deal? Ephesians 6:12 gives us a hint: "Our battle is not against flesh and blood..." Also, Jesus Himself tells us that we will face great persecution (Matthew 24:9) and even that if we really <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> love God, we should even <span style="font-style: italic;">expect</span> to face persecution. So I suppose that when people mock our faith, when they "persecute" (this word I use in a basic sense, it is highly unlikely that anyone in America has faced stoning or painful death because of their faith), when they treat us with derision, we are ready since we know it's bound to come. I mean, you <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> know you will be laughed at and picked on for your faith, <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> you? Basically, I am saying that in Christianity we know that people will hate us for knowing the truth so when they do we don't seem to react.

Maybe it's time for Christian's to get off their asses and protest, even violently oppose the worldly views and beliefs? I don't think that God commanded us to do so, it seems He wasn't so much interested in a worldview (don't get me wrong, He did use violence at least once so He is interested, but you get my point?) but very interested in changing <span style="font-style: italic;">people</span>. Kids, let me tell it to you straight, it's not so much about changing the laws on abortion (legal to illegal, a serious issue) but it's about changing the <span style="font-style: italic;">hearts</span> of the people around us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you ever hurt inside and you can't stand the silence? You know, those times when maybe something in your past cries out to be heard, something in the past is pushing and fighting it's way to the surface needing to be heard and felt. But maybe, just maybe, you're not ready to let that thought be heard, not ready to let that emotion touch you. So you turn the music a little louder. Turn it up a bit more until it drives all those other thoughts from your mind, and then when people come by and wonder why the music is so loud, you can't really answer can you? Because if you told them it's because you are still running in your mind, if you said you were afraid and terrified inside to face whatever is hiding, they wouldn't understand. So you turn the music a bit louder, louder, louder...

This happens to me consistently.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel obliged to say something about this day, being the day of forced romance, but I don't feel so bad knowing I would have said something anyway. So here we go:

Valentine's day is crazy man, let me tell you something: I went to Wal-Mart (that miserable place) and what did I see but that 80 percent of the people were men. Surprised? You should be, since I heard that around 80 percent of all Valentine's day cards are mailed by women. I have this thought, see, and I think I'm in the money on this one. Women like to let other people know what they are feeling (in a very general sense) so I think Valentine's day is an excuse to let their friends know they are thought of and loved (not in a romantic way usually). But a guy isn't worried whether a guy knows what he's feeling (again, in a general sense) so Valentine's day is just a day where you do something special for that girlfriend/spouse/etc.

Take that whole paragraph however you want, I was just thinking out loud.

Another thing I noticed is that single people get engry about today. I don't. I really don't care a whole lot. No, seriously! I see a lot of hearts and stuffed bears and the like, but I don't get thinking about "Poor me, I'm so single and lonely, boo-hoo." I think one reason I don't really care about Valentine's day is because I don't like the concept a whole lot. It seems forced. It seems almost worse than Christmas, it's just so commercialized and no one cares that it is. No one cares that it's overly commercialized.

But anyway, I really don't care about Valentine's day. But if I were married, I would probably still do something special, make my own card at least, and cook a special dinner or something. That's it. Later...]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that you have realized som very profound truths about Valentine's day, and I agree with you that it is much too commercialized and "forced". But, if you broaden the scope of V.D. from a romantic holiday to a holiday celebrating all kinds of love (I cannot express myself exactly the way I want to when I write this in English, because English has only one word for love, so I'll try in French) Si vous amplifiez le sens et inclurer tous l'expressions de l'amitie, je pense que le celebration devenit plus significatif. My family exchanges gifts on V. D. instead of Christmas, which has the added benefit of allowing Christmas to resume its proper meaning.<br/>As to single people being angry on V. D., I think it's because they are selfish and don't want to "miss out" on all the "fun".]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday it snowed. Not a whole lot, you understand, just a few inches. But now it's pretty cold, cold as in zero or negative degrees, cold as in I froze my water pipes cold. Umm. So yeah. Working out at this camp, they provide you with free housing and utilities. A good deal you say? A very good deal I say. But, always some cons are found with the pro's. This house I live in is actually a trailer, so it's not mouse-proof (in fact, it acts as a magnet to mice, a problem I am fixing with a "mouse house de-magnetizer" product), and also it's not very insulative. And when I say not very insulative, I mean, if you feel the walls, they are already cold enough to keep your bee--um soda quite chilled. Also, there just happens to be a little water pipe which runs practically on the outside of the trailer, so it freezes quite nicely. So nicely in fact, that it did. I didn't tell maintenance yet, mostly I am hoping the pipe thawed out with the "warm" weather and electric heater I applied to it. I have to go now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The pipes are thawed and the water is flowing, like golden beams of sunlight, falling on the evening sky. Truly this is magnificent! I went back to my trailer and heard much water flowing, anxiously looking to see if my bathroom flooded, I found no drop of water outside the sink. Or outside the pipes either, which means they didn't burst. Praise the Lord of heaven and earth!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Short bursts,
like words,
bits of poetry,
of how it was,
how  it really was.

So many lies,
for so many years,
I even  believe them,
lies I've told myself
enough to be convinced.

How  do I find it,
that truth behind my lies
except through the ones  behind them.

I could go on a freefall
through terrains  uncharted, unknown.
Past distant memories and a blurry past,
on  into what looks now like a dream.
And what will I find when I arrive?

If  truth be found and revived once more,
it is even through sorrow and  tears I would travel.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sitting at this table
watching you smile and talk,
you always  compose yourself
with such precision,
no strand of hair misplaced.

Is  that your friend?
She talks much more than you
and you sit so  silent.
But in your mind you wander
a distance farther
than the  space between you and I.

That friend of yours has left
and  now you sit in silence
(both mouth and eyes strangely still)
Later  the friend returns and you smile,
it makes me wonder what
was  going on inside your head.

I say hello, you say hello,
we  smile and nod and say goodbye.
You will never tell me,
and I am  afraid to ask,
whats on your heart
and inside of your mind
that  is always reflected into your eyes.]]></content:encoded>

What's  on my mind, in my head,
it's all the same thing.

on the teeter-totter?
We talked for hours
about  simply everything,

Remember when we lay,

The  sky was cloudless,
there were so many stars,
It was 3am before
we  left each other that night.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Within the past few weeks I started dreaming again. This is officially not cool.

I stopped dreaming several years ago (officially, this was related to the flying monkeys dream sequence, but you didn't hear that from me), since then not a single dream has come my way as I slept. Lately, as in the past three weeks or so, I have had these dreams which really annoy me.

Have you ever had a dream that felt so real that when you woke up, you couldn't really tell whether it was a dream or a memory? I have struggles with memories a lot, part of that struggle is with these dreams which are so real to me that I can't tell if they are a memory come back to life or just a dream. Last nights dream, for example, I had a dream which was extremely realistic in many ways, but once I start to really think about it, it becomes certain that it was a dream. I think.

Have you ever had a dream that you knew "meant something" in some vague sense? I have, I can distinguish between a normal dream and a "premonition" dream. Some dreams are a caution to me, or a guide. Now, I'm not saying any such BS like "follow your dreams" or whatever, I'm just saying that some of my dreams have helped me. They are unlike the next kind.

Have you ever had a dream which came to pass? Some people might call it a vision or something, I have them while I sleep so I call them dreams. Sometimes I can see into the future, my dreams tell me what will happen. Once, I hoped it was more than a novelty trick, that it was supposed to help me somehow. But it didn't. I thought perhaps it was to give me time to think about some precarious decision, but no matter what choice I made real life always followed the dream. Maybe it was to give me comfort, or peace, knowing that something will happen. Well you know what? You can take those dreams and send them back to where they came from. I don't need a dream to tell me of the future if I can't change anything. I don't need a dream to tell me I have some relational tension, I already know that. I don't need dreams. Period. Go away dreams! Go bother someone else!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes I watch television, I can't say I enjoy it very much though. But listen while I throw some punches at worldly logic:

Commercials for Prozac/WhoCares all say the same thing: Are you not happy? Are you lonely? Are you fat? Are you bored? Are you depressed? Try this drug, it will grant you immediate happiness and true life completion!!!!!!

I'm going to tell you a secret, you can't let anyone know you heard it from me. I'm not married. I don't have a girlfriend. I don't think I have any prospects for a girlfriend. I have a hard time thinking of any girls I know who I would want to have as a girlfriend (sure, there are a couple). But I do know one thing: A relationship with another person (male/female) will never give me happiness or satisfaction. The only true peace you can find and the only <em>true</em> happiness you will <em>ever</em> know in this pitiful world is when you seek after God.

<strong>Newsbreak:</strong> None of the following things will give you true happiness: Alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, a new girlfriend or boyfriend, hanging with your crew, on and on and on...

That's what annoys me with all these commercials, you don't deserve to be happy with your boyfriend. It's like I'm living in a world of escape artists, all trying to escape that loneliness that comes from following your own sinful, selfish desires. But we all know inside that these things never truly satisfy. Only a relationship with Christ, and you truly seeking God's desire, will give true satisfaction. All else is an accessory. Your relationship with that other person is only satisfying if you both seek and follow God's will.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Greetings all. I will be in Lincoln this up and coming Sunday, I am preparing a banquet at the Lincoln Berean church, a desert banquet. Anybody want to come and hang out? And by hang out I mean help? And by help I men volunteer your time on Sunday to the ministry of this Bible camp? I don't imagine anyone will be interested, but if you are in Lincoln you could stop in after church (about 2pm I will start preparing the deserts) and say hello. Seriously, if you stop and say hello you will probably make my day. Anyway, I have not got a lot of time lately, getting ready for this banquet, so I don't have time to wrote any brilliant thesis. Next week will be great: Spring break! Whoever came up with that idea is crazy, I don't care for it. But it does mean I will have a little time to write a goodly post. Here I go promising things again...]]></content:encoded>

We will be withing ten miles of each other, probably closer.<br/><br/>My suggestion for you on Spring Break is to read the Peavar / Volhonsky translation of Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov". It is a brilliant, wonderful book. If we didn't have the Bible, "T.B.K." would be sufficient.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a good time in Lincoln, less people showed up to the banquet than I had hoped, but it turned out alright. Thanks to the "W.C.", <a href="http://norsola.blogspot.com/">William</a>, for coming from Omaha and helping out. We had wonderful conversations as always, W quoted a bit of poetry which was thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks to <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/60907302">Angie</a> and Michelle, for coming from Crete and helping, we had some good times and they sure were helpful. Thanks also to the Maranatha staff who helped out (Scot, Angela, Crystal, JoAnn, RuthAnn, Tad, George and Jan) and decorated the place, it was great! Many thanks go to my brother <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/28264591">Nathan</a>, who came up from Omaha to be my assistant Chef and personal driver, etc... Definitely a great helper and friend! Thanks also to the Choir who helped serve punch and help at the tables. Thanks to that one kid (I didn't ever catch his name) who helped me find my way around the church and get carts and so on, and to all the extra people who came in and out helping here and there.

The banquet itself went without any real hitches, we served some various cheesecakes (provided by <a href="http://www.hippfoods.com/">Hipp</a>), some blueberry tarts, some Apple Fillo tortes, lots of fresh fruit, and some raspberry fillo parfait's. It was great and delicious, I got plenty of comments on the apple fillo tortes, I have a little web-site which I will post pictures and recipes on in a couple weeks.

Thanks again everybody, for all your help, it was great fun!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What is the difference between federal and state government?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal government spending is out of hand. That's my initial statement. Those of you who know me, know I don't usually talk politics, so this may be a bit unusual for me. Bear with me for a minute or two.

As for the signing of the Constitution of the United States, all states were operating separately and without a set standard. The federal government was created to put an "umbrella" over all states: Now all states have their own rules and judicial branches, but they operate within a certain set of standards set forth in the constitution. That the federal government was not created to run everything is quite clear, since a system was set up for the protection of the power of the states through senators and representatives etc... However, all that changed when WWI started: Suddenly the entire nation was under siege, all its peoples were in danger, so we reacted. We reacted by spending billions of dollars and setting a tax. Know we all know that the declaration of independence discusses taxation--taxation without representation among others--and we know (or we used to know) that taxes were not necessary. But as soon as we started the war, we had to pay for all the guns and bombs and technology development and so on, so the federal government created a federal tax.

That tax has never been repealed, even though we finished the war long ago.

Take us forward to the year 1945. The second world war is over (basically) and from 1940 to 1946, our federal government increased it's spending from 100 billion to 1,000 billion (one trillion) an increase of 1000%/factor of one/ten times as much. Our federal government has spent 500 billion dollars of money it didn't have, so it increased taxation of the people, bypassing state taxes to create a higher federal tax. From there on out things just kept getting worse, federal spending increased from 1940 to 2000 to a total of nearly 2 trillion dollars--in 2006, an estimated 2.7 trillion dollars. Now, with the war in Iraq needing so much money, federal spending is increasing faster and faster.

I'm going to take a break from political talk, and discuss algebra for just a second. All of you remember functions from algebra? If we say f(x)=x+1 then if we say x=1, the function of x is 2. Remember that basic idea? Or if we say f(x)=2x and say x=2, the function of x=4. Okay, then we take the input and call it x, and the output we call y. Remember now? Let's keep going for a little bit more: If we say that f(x)=x^2 and say x=2, y will be 4. If x=3, y=9. And if x=4, y=16. So we see that for whatever value of x, it's output is increasing 'exponentially'. An exponential increase graph looks like this:

<a href="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/basicexponential.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1284" title="basicexponential" src="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/basicexponential.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="322" /></a>Notice how the line on the right goes up faster and faster? That's what an exponential graph looks like. As the line moves to the right, it moves faster and faster upward, so at x=20, y=400. And if x=200, y=40,000 and so on, reaching closer and closer to infinity.

All systems, natural or man-made, which reach for infinity eventually reach a point where such values are absurd. All systems which reach for infinity will fail.

The basic exponential increase of the federal taxation is (ignoring the huge spike during 1940's): f(x)=(.0026x^2)+.1 Where y is the number multiplied by 100,000,000,000 to get dollars.

<a href="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/spendingexponential.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1285" title="spendingexponential" src="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/spendingexponential-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></a>This goes off of two assumptions: The increase in federal spending is an even increase (it is not, it spikes and falls, so prediction is difficult), and initial value of federal budget. The initial value of the federal budget is not entirely accurate, but it is certainly close enough for armchair calculations. Let me take that little graph and zoom out a bit so you can see how quickly federal spending will increase:

<a href="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/spendingto2100.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1286" title="spendingto2100" src="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/spendingto2100-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" /></a>
Now, before you forget how big of a number that is, lets put it in real digits so you can see it: By 2050, the federal (federal only, remember you still have state and local taxes) tax will be: $5,800,000,000,000 Which in a more real amount, is enough money to buy over twenty three million houses at $250,000 each. Omaha had 165,731 housing units in 2000 A.D., with the amount of money spent in the 2050 federal budget, you could buy 139 Omaha's.

I don't think I need to say anything else to drive my point in, but I will. Let's take the 2.7 Trillion dollar actual federal budget and compare it to the total number of people in America: 2.7 Trillion / 296 Million = $9121 per person. All I did was divide, and I found that if everyone paid equally, we would each pay $9,121 per year in taxes. Or let's take a rich person's income, lets say someone gets paid $200,000 per year. That's a heck of a lot more than anyone <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> know makes, but we'll go with it: 2.7 Trillion / 200 Thousand = 13,500,000 People. Each year, America pays enough taxes to pay very good salaries to over 13 million people. Remember once again, that's not counting state and local people, just federal. There are an approximate 10 million people in Los Angeles in 2004, all of those people could be living very well-to-do lives on your federal tax alone.

If you have all those 13 million people who receive a salary of $200,000 a year in the government, and we divide those people by the total population, we get: 296 Million (U.S. Population) / 13 Million (paid government) = 22. For every 22 people in this country, we have one highly paid government official. Except we still have state taxes and local taxes, so that number is even lower, probably closer to 10 people per official.

Doesn't this sound a little fishy to you? What are we spending our money on anyway? Oh, I know: NASA Nonsense = 16 Billion; War = 249 Billion; Department of Justice = 2.7 Billion; Department of Defense = 16 Billion; Homeland Security = 24 Billion; Etcetera... All just a bunch of nonsense designed to keep the country in debt.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am right now listening to some really crazy sounding music by Daler Mehndi, it is real weird.

Also, I am leaving to Omaha right now. I mean, within about 20 minutes. I mean, I hope to be of here by 10am.

I am going to a wedding, I am going to a food show in Omaha to spend around 30 G's. That's $30,000 on food stuff. Then On Tuesday I am going to Kearney to spend another 10 G's. Another $10,000 in cool cash.

I would appreciate your prayers that I spend the money wisely, I have a budget of nearly $120,000 for the entire year on food alone, so anything I can get at this food show to save money is good. Also, since this is a non-profit Christian ministry, I am praying that I can spend this donated money wisely.

Peace out yo.]]></content:encoded>

If I stay on this path, perhaps I will end up running a restaurant. That would be fine I guess, married to a sweet little woman, we could have a nice deal going on. Or maybe I could just move out to the countryside, raise a family, be safe. I could spend my days being happy, no more sorrow and no more fear. Some days I think that I could do this, leave behind all those thoughts of science, leave behind those books and studies. I could look at the sky again and feel the cool spring breeze run through my fingers and whisk through my hair. Come with me, brother.

<img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;" src="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/03/facelooksleft.jpg" alt="" border="0" />Some days I just want to leave this life I made, go to a big university and study forever. And then I could think of things that trouble me, some days I want to but there's no time. I could get lost in a trance, a stupifying dream of never-ending waltzes with the daemons of logic and sanity. Oh to be lost again, to feel the earth pulling me toward it's center, to see the little people again and watch them dance in the snow laden boughs of heavy winter. I could leave to a land where the sun never shines, cast myself into dark shadow, never to return. Come with me, brother.]]></content:encoded>

I will say: "I don't know."

But if you ask: "Tell me why the sky is so gray."
I will tell you it is because
in another land,
far across the ocean,
a small man sits
alone on his porch
swatting flies
and rocking in his chair
staring into space
remembering a day in the past
when he told his biggest lie
and said to a girl he loved
"I don't really love you."

He turns the sky gray.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now I know what your probably thinking, Spring starts on some... other... day. Well, I don't know when your schedule says Spring can start, but the order of the earth (OOTE, pronounced "ooh-t") is usually a bit different. Take winter for instance, winter can sometimes extend into May, sometimes it has gone as far as June. Or it could start as late as February, or as early as July. It's true, the OOTE is different than the man-made version. So here is how I know it's spring:

When the webs of the spider shine, like gossamer floating in the wind, is seen by the setting sun. When the grassy hue changes from brown to dark green, lush and alive. When all things once asleep finally step out of their earthy beds, then it is spring.

A little thing caught my eye today, such a thing as never seen before, the grass is now awake again. Maybe you can't see it, maybe you can: The difference between the grass that sleeps and the grass that is awake, but there is also the grass which is dead.

Need I say more?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with you, that the manmade definition of the seasons is rather arbitrary, and the OOTE is more accurate. For me, spring begins when the Silver Maples set fruit. This occured last week.<br/><br/>April is the cruellest month, breeding<br/>lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br/>memory and desire, stirring<br/>dull roots with spring rain.<br/>Winter kept us warm, covering<br/>earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br/>a little life with dried tubers.<br/><br/>---T.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I experienced one of the most enjoyable math classes so far, the trig teacher was producing an equation and going pretty fast (I'm talking about real lengthy ones: (cosA-cos(-B))^2+(sinA-sin(-B)^2=((cos(A+B)+0)^2 and on and on like this for two pages of writing), this was fun. Seriously, I thought it was great! A lot of the people were saying things like "That's too hard" or "I think my brain just exploded" or whatever. I am ready for more! I have to go home and memorize these equations, because it takes about 10 minutes to produce them.

Note to self: Learn to write without looking.

When I get into my higher Calculus classes, I suspect the teachers will be faster and write longer. It is a story I keep hearing repeated, so I have to figure out either how to write faster to keep up, or get a good bit of software to type in mathematics fast or something. Because I can't keep up the pace with them, I could hardly keep up with this guy's writing, and this is only trig!

Later peeps.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I got my motorcycle carburetor back from the shop, I just popped it on and started the ol' girl up. SHE LIVES!!!!!!!! AHHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! Sorry. After my earlier motorcycle was stolen by some ruthless immature (but I am slandering, my apologies) person, I have not ridden a motorcycle, this being perhaps one year now. But today I finally got my "new"--that is, different than the old one--motorcycle to tun. I have to tune and synchronize the carbs, rework the front and rear disc brakes, and find a headlight assembly, but it's finally coming together. I think that it will be ready by summer, that is my goal at least: Road ready by middle of May. I don't yet have the title for it either, so I will have to get that, and then insure it, and so on and so on. But it sure is nice to ride again! This one is a Suzuki 850, so it has much more power and much more weight than my old Honda 175. I don't think it will be nearly as hair-raising an event to be passed by a semi-truck.

Well, I must be off to wash many dishes, farewell!

P.S. I am currently reading "The Brothers Karamazov", which is a very long novel, it has been worth my time so far.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Illogical behaviour.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been reflecting on some things today, ever since someone told me they don't think abortion is wrong. I didn't respond to them, but I have been thinking about how people seem to think certain immoral behavior my be acceptable at times. For instance, consider the illogicality people have when they say it is wrong to kill an animal, and then say it is acceptable to kill a fetus. I have been thinking of how irrational people are, specifically, that people can have two opposing beliefs and be okay with that. Or how people can have an unfounded morality, they say one thing is wrong but have no reasoning or basis behind it. "It's just wrong!" is something I am hearing far too often.

Let me tell you a piece of rhetoric I hear from the pro-choice side far too often: "A woman should have a right to choose." False, false, false. If you simply reword this statement into it's basic form, it would say: "One person has the right to choose when someone dies." Which is quite silly, don't you think? If your daughter came to you and said that Grandma was getting on her nerves, can't I just kill her, do you think your response would be "My daughter has the right to choose." I hope your response is different.

"You are not looking at the feelings of the mother." True, I don't care about the mothers feelings, when did we decide that because something makes us feel bad that we could get rid of it? Hey, it's America right! What you don't want, you throw away, like cardboard and soda cans we just pitch them into the trash. If I don't sound very sensitive, it's because I am not willing to be sensitive to someones feelings over the life of another human being. What would your response be if I said "You just aren't looking at the feelings of the terrorists who crashed into the twin towers, don't they have a right to choose?" Come on now, who has the right to choose to end someone's life?

"It's my body, it's my choice." Wrong, wrong, dreadfully wrong. The body inside of you is not yours, it is not you. This is easily demonstrated by DNA testing, the DNA of the newly conceived is not the same from the very instant of conception. Another example I have heard is that an infant can have a penis, but a woman doesn't have one. This is a very obvious proof that what is inside of you is not your own body. But secondly, you can't do anything you want to your body, the law prohibits many things, such as illicit drugs. It's not your body, and you can't do whatever you want with your body anyway.

What it boils down to eventually is that the pro-choice crowd says that an unborn person is not human, or is not a person. First of all, to say someone can be a human but not a person is irrational. It's a simple word game to obfuscate the fact that every human is a human. Irrational behavior makes me mad. But also, to say that an unborn child is not a human is also biologically illogical. If it isn't a human, what is it? A dog? A cat? Biological law says from humans come humans, a thing descended from a human is in fact human. Or again, an unborn child turns into a full fledged adult, at what point was it ever not human? Never. From the moment it acquired DNA from male and female, it became it's own identity and became human.

Irrational people make me mad.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Read <a href="http://www.netlink.de/gen/Zeitung/970404.htm">this</a> post on "food slander", apparently it is a civil crime to denigrate or criticize foods without "scientific basis". I am noticing something in this crazy country of ours (I don't claim to know much about other countries) which is that "science" is looked upon as an absolute, an unquestionable force, infallible and inerrant. That is patently absurd! No scientific thought today should be looked upon as absolute truth, if the truth were told we would find that any scientific thought is still a theory to be improved and worked on, but by fallen minds.

Look at this article, maybe just the first few paragraphs, where it talks about a limitation of freedom of speech.

Essentially, it says that we can't say anything bad about modified foods, we cant say anything to criticize the milk industry (for example).

When did we get to the point where we can't speak out against companies which are killing us with their chemicals, but we could go downtown and dance around naked partaking in sexual orgies and call it "freedom of speech"?

This country is ridiculous.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am at school. I have to pee. I am almost finished with finals, I finished trigonometry this morning and I am pretty sure I did real well, I just hope all my plus'es and minus'es were in the right place... Also, BIOLOGY FINALS TONIGHT!!!!!!!11111111 (All those 1's are to make sure that, as if a dozen exclamation points were not enough, you understand my excitement) I am very glad to be done with this class now, I will be lucky to pull off a B, which really just makes me mad. MAD MAD MAD! I should be getting an A or a B+, but I have issues with secular styled teaching. I will divulge myself later.

Also, I got my motorcycle going the other day, I hope to be able to ride it to Omaha for Mother's day! I will post a picture of it sometime soon, not having a camera seriously limits me in this regard. I have a plastic gas tank sitting on the frame right now while I tune it up, the real tank just needs to be washed out and it's ready. Also, there is no headlight assembly. But I took it for a little spin on some pavement and it really kicks you back in the seat if you push it! Woop woop! There are some little things here and there that I need to tighten down, but it should be ready in time (so long as the paperwork passes inspection).

Anyway, I have to go finish studying and hope I can get a B in this class. Later on I will write something "real" or "important" or something similar.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Questions to assist you in determining whether you are in love.</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Props to me for longest title!

So I was hunting around through some old paperwork I had stacked in corners of my house, and I came across this list that was titled "QUESTIONS TO DETERMINE IF IN LOVE". So I read through them (not that I am asking myself these questions about anyone in particular) and decided they were very good questions to ask. They are not simple "Yes or no" questions, they are meant to provoke thought and get you to see things that you probably didn't notice before. So here I go with the questions, for posterity:
<ol>
	<li>Do you like the company of the other person?</li>
	<li>Is the individual personally attractive to you? Do you feel inclined to apologize for appearance, manners, ideas, conversation, language?</li>
	<li>How do you make up after a quarrel or difference?</li>
	<li>As you look back over the relationship from the beginning, how has it changed?</li>
	<li>Do you have common interests? Did you have these interests before you met? Or did you become interested in the other persons interests?</li>
	<li>Has enough time passed to tell if it is true love or infatuation?</li>
	<li>Is anything more than physical attraction present?</li>
	<li>Do you love the individual as a person or do you like merely your feelings about him/her? Are you in love with the personality or "in love with love"?</li>
	<li>Does the person "wear well" with your friends?</li>
	<li>Are you attracted to the person for what he/she is or for what he/she can give you or do for you?</li>
	<li>Over what matters and how frequently do you have conflict? Is the conflict open or supressed? Is it superficial or fundamental?</li>
	<li>Are you willing to make concessions, or do you always expect the other person to do the pleasing, agreeing, and adjusting?</li>
	<li>Do you have any doubts about your love?</li>
	<li>How do you weather a crisis together?</li>
	<li>Is yours a case in which a strong physical attraction tends to draw you toward the other person, while an intelligent appraisal of personality makes you resist the physical appeal?</li>
	<li>Do you feel that, if you let yourself go and loved the other person as much as you might, you would become submerged in his/her personalityand lose your individuality?</li>
	<li>Are you sufficient stimulus for each other when you are together, or do you require external stimuli to prevent boredom?</li>
	<li>In your mind, how does the person compare to others? Are you constantly looking for "greener pastures"?</li>
	<li>What is the relationship between your enthusiasm and the presence or absence of the other person?</li>
	<li>Do you forgive, tolerate, accept, overlook, or resent faults and shortcomings? Do you love the person faults and all, or are you holding yourself in check pending reform?</li>
	<li>Do you see the other persons faults and their significance? Or do you merely see faults in a distant, detached way without realizing what those faults would mean in marriage?</li>
	<li>How much do you think of the other persons welfare and happiness?</li>
	<li>Is there anything or anybody in life that you consider more valuableto you than this other person or that you love more than you love him/her? If so, what or who is it and what does this fact mean to you?</li>
	<li>Do you have a desire to escape an unhappy home, school, or work situation?</li>
	<li>What has been your reaction to these questions? Have you found it difficult to be honest with yourself? Have you rationalized any of your answers?</li>
</ol>
Some more questions followed these, titled "QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER BEFORE MARRIAGE". Some of them do not seem very Bible focused, but whatever.
<ol>
	<li>Can I accept his/her faults and shortcomings?</li>
	<li>Can I visualize and accept him/her in the various roles he/she must play during our marriage (i.e., father/mother, sweetheart, provider, companion, lover, etc...)</li>
	<li>Would I be willing to give up things to provide things that would be important to the satisfaction of his/her needs?</li>
	<li>Is there the tender feeling that comes from knowing that he/she is on your side and is interested in satisfying your needs?</li>
	<li>Is there a feeling of solid and enduring friendship?</li>
	<li>Is he/she sexually attractive to me?</li>
	<li>Do we enjoy many of the same things, and share similar or compatible goals?</li>
	<li>Do I feel comfortable when I am in the company of his/her family and friends?</li>
	<li>Do I like who I am, or the way I feel about myself when I am with him/her?</li>
	<li>Has our courtship been relatively smooth and enjoyable?</li>
	<li>Are his/her personal hygienic standards similar to, or compatible with mine?</li>
	<li>Am I willing to accept the responsibility, as far as is reasonable, for making the relationship work?</li>
</ol>
So that's it. Those are the questions. Some of them might hit home pretty hard to those of you who are infatuated with someone, some of those questions seem pretty arbitrary though... Anyway, I mostly wrote this down so I could have a digital copy of it. So...........]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once, I spent an entire day organizing receipts in order of date and time. This took me at least 4 hours, but it could have been as many as 8. Then, I took these receipts and burned them. Why would you do that? Why would someone do something so strange? I will not say.

Speaking of burning, I suggest a heretical book burning and at the same time take your television and place it on the flames. Burn the television. Yes, you.

I watch television sometimes, but I am not fond of it. I would rather be doing something else, like finishing my forge and building an electrolysis cell for hydrogen production. But the television captures your eye so effectively, and 24 was such a good show. Rather, I found myself watching 24 very often, only this season, but I don't really care about it.

Last night I rode my motorcycle home and experienced a flat tire, my back tire must have caught some bit of rebar or something, so I was effectively stranded for several hours. But, I made it back without a scratch, and the bike rides really well. After a couple hours driving it stopped sputtering, and after 300 miles of riding the oil leak stopped and the front tire stopped losing pressure. I have found that when you get a vehicle that has been sitting a long time, just get it rideable and a lot of the immediate kinks work themselves out. Except my flat tire.

I carried enough tools with me that I could completely disassemble the bike, but it had to be a flat tire...

Anyway, there isn't even two weeks left before the summer staff shows up, and we are very desperately needing more help in the kitchen. So, if you want to work out here for even a couple weeks during the summer, I would be very happy. There are about three weeks where 600ish people will be here. SCARY!!!!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello friends and strangers, my name is Tobias Davis.

I live in a strangely colorful world, where I see many visions and dream every night of a place I have been and will return to. I confuse people, I confuse myself. If you imagine a world of change, always changing, I will be there with you.

I am writing for a very specific reason today, that being a temporary goodbye. Today starts the long stretch of time where I will be occupied with serving and pursuing God and His direction in my life, I will be serving Him proudly this summer until late August. Until the end of summer, around the start of school, I will not be here on this computer telling you things you don't need to know.

What I am saying is, goodbye.

Goodbye until August returns us fair weather and golden harvest skies.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>But why do roses have thorns?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night I re-read one of my favorite books, of which I feel naming online would do it injustice. In this book, a little boy asks this man "Do sheep eat roses?", to which the man replied that, of course they do. "But then, why do roses have the thorns?", asked the boy. The man replied that it didn't matter, it wasn't of consequence, or that the roses have thorns out of spite.

But don't you see, that if you have a rose who is your friend on another star, that you can look up at the stars and they become beautiful, because up there on one of those stars is your friend. But, if sheep eat roses, even with thorns, every star becomes dark to you. And that man said that the thorns were of no consequence...

Anyway, what I really wanted to tell you was that I am still at camp, I am still alive, there are only three and one-half weeks left of the summer and then I will write again more regularly. Have patience, I have many hard thoughts to say when I come back.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the other night I had a really weird experience trying to fall asleep. I was lying on my stomach, which I usually don't do but it was feeling pretty comfortable just about then, meanwhile I was drifting in and out of sleep, it was one of those nights where I just couldn't get sleeping--something about certain cycles of the moon. So there I am, just drifting around, and I get a muscle twitch. Not to uncommon while awake, I often have spasms of pain or sometimes where my hand will twitch for several minutes and I have never been able to figure out how to get it to stop. So like maybe my leg twitches, then my arm, then all of a sudden my whole body is doing this twitching deal where if I didn't know better I would say I was having a seizure except I was completely aware the whole time of what was going on. So basically I sat there for about ten minutes, trying to figure out what was going on, not really caring about it enough to get up and stretch which probably would have made it stop. I noticed that I have this tendency to try and regain control of these spasms by mental faculty alone, so if my finger is twitching I will try and regain control with my mind. Anyway, after ten minutes the twitching stopped and so I fell asleep. That is the end of the story I guess.

I also caught three mice just last night, two on a sticky trap and the other one must have got caught on the sticky trap and ran under my furnace. Dang, the house is going to start smelling funny I bet.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once, I sent a venusian teleporter through the global grid-matrix. That didn't turn out so well, since the reult was a bionucleotic breakdown of the primordial soup. Even though the results were disastrous, the laughing was what really broke down galactic affairs: Venus declared war on Mars, since that is where the uranium factories were placed. Practically, the Martians handed over the factory and Venus got away with murder, which is what they wanted in the first place. But now, the sub-particle accelerator is broken and no one is here to fix it, so here I float in outer space with my dog "Squintios the Third" waiting for someone to walk by and notice the power switch at Mars has been accidentally switched off. Since Mars' government is now defunct and the grid-matrix is down, this could take a couple thousand years.

Since there's no aging here, and since most weapons don't work here, I guess I'll have to find the last remaining axe and chop my head off. At least Squintios the Third will get a decent meal for once in his life, too bad he will have to be shot at the next stop. I hope they see him grinning with part of my intestine hanging out of his mouth, that would be a shocker.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wonder what would happen if I decided that I had an elephant for a pet? Would the implosion of large corridors happen simply because my brainstem decided that falling off of a 35 foot cliff would be the simplest thing possible? Or maybe the end of western civilization would come because my toothpick could not longer reset the flux capacitor, or reverse the polarity of the declension of my teeth?<br/><br/>What do you think might be the occurance when I sent the tendril-waving brigade out on a short errand? Do you think they would come back, larvae in hand, happily, begging to live out their appendages on my anti-psychosis drugs? Perhaps they would dream a dream of blue skies, and little tangerine-like menaces.<br/><br/>The result of all of this is that I simply do not have the item to sustain the imagery that I have concocted: rather, that I know in part that which today, entirely fails to explain why the brother of General Brumstad used to know the detective's sister.<br/><br/>The approach of a new planet has a large group of biologists wondering what the fauna on Mars is like. While this may seem unrelated, it is actually quite key to the understanding of a number of possibilities that were left unresolved in the Matrix sequels. I can point at two in particular - the question of Ripley's insomnia, and what exactly happened to Captain Von Schienderhosen on April 7th, 1923? So, you see, this is a burning controversy in the antediluvian circles who are concerned with the comet Bubastes.<br/><br/>Wherefore does the end of a small black carpet spell disaster for our anti-heroes? Why, perhaps the noblest thing that could be done for Shep at this point is to let him out of the cage that his dog inhabits. You see, nothing can be done for the philosophical questions of life : Who am I, where is Casanova, and what, pray tell, does the fourth sequence in the DNA of a horned frog spell in Castellan? Do you have any possible solutions for these meandering, nonsensical questions?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you can take a few minutes right now, just stop and think of this one person:

Search into your furthest memories and strain to see the image of that one who appeared to you in a dream, that someone whose face appeared to you but a minute and you knew in your heart...

<span style="font-style: italic;">"Who are you? ... What are you doing in my dream and capturing my heart?"</span>

She never answered me, that frail and ethereal vision, but in my heart I knew she was that person that completed me. Illusory? Perhaps. It is an abstruse phantom, but it plagues my heart to this day.

And then one day I look and see that face, that someone I knew from my dreams, she stood right in front of me once and I held her hand and said words of power and confession, and I saw that look in her eyes that I had seen many years before in memories far removed:

<span style="font-style: italic;">"In truth, I love you and it shall always be this way."</span>

And time went by, that face that I once saw retreated from my memory into the cold of amnesic indifference. And I told a lie I will never forget, but a few words could break the world around me so quickly, and I didn't understand why I would say those things.

<span style="font-style: italic;">"My love for you is only as to a sister."</span>

And so I made myself believe a lie, and in that lie was deliverance and absolution from the first lie. Life continued and still goes on, pressing unrelentingly forever forward, and I have forgotten how I could let this one person walk away.

How can I go on living, seeing this face which haunts me forever and tells me what I let go and what terrible lie I told.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, guess what time it is? It is 5:17 AM, and I have not yet gone to bed.

What?!? So I went to town and talked to a friend and ended up in the office (I had to put away some groceries, so I stopped into the office afterward) and that was almost 2 AM, and so I did a little reading and some catching up and so on, and now it is almost 5:30 AM which, incidentally, is when my shift normally starts.

Except, I have the morning off, so I don't have to work until 9 AM-ish. So here is what I am thinking: I have a lengthy letter to write to a friend, and some things to do at the house, so why not stay up and pull an all-nighter? As much as I enjoy the physical act of sleeping, sleep is a thief, and also it seems to be a waste of time. So I have to bugger out of here before my morning crew catches me down here and they start calling me ridiculous and so on. Not that I truly care what they call me, but I don't want to have to explain myself.

So good night, everyone.]]></content:encoded>

Have you ever heard a child scream at the top of their lungs, "I NEED MORE GLUE TO COMPLETE MY GYMNASTICS TEAM, UNCLE RAY?" I watched as a the toads came in and signed a peace treaty with the Termite emperor the day before yesterday. The guacamole was left outside in the rain, and had a lovely conversation with an abstract painting by Salvador Dali. Incidentally, the reaction of most hueristic alogrithms to doors is the same reaction that elephants have to seeing their cousin Vinny for the first time since that one cold night in Philadelphia, 1978, when Vinny drove off with the '56 Chevy. And the girl. But we don't really like to talk about the girl.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After staying awake all night, I came in to work at 9AM and worked a half day until about 4PM. Later I went and did other stuff and hung out, all standard fare items, and finally decided to go to sleep about 1AM. So, all said and done, I stayed awake for 44 hours straight and here is the end result: I was not tired. I didn't feel "dizzy" or whatever that you usually feel from lack of sleep, I didn't feel emotionally worn out or anything like that. I kept a close eye on my emotions and how I treated people and I don't think it was influenced at all by lack of sleep. In mental focus, I didn't lose any--then again, I haven't been able to focus very well for several weeks, I think this is from improper nutrition and lack of proper physical exertion. After work, towards the end of the experiment, I was looking at the computer and I almost dozed off a couple times, but when I noticed this I was able to "wake up" again through mental persuasion.

All in all, I think I could get away from sleeping for perhaps one night a week, maybe two. So far, I haven't been able to sleep in and I have been getting to bed around 1AM as usual, still no side effects. I don't think I could get away with no sleep, but perhaps once a week I could do without and have no ill effects.

Imagine if I could do this: An extra 8 or so hours of time possible each week, adding up to 18 extra days per year! Now, out here is an ideal location for this, since I am not tempted to go into town and spend money or otherwise non-productive things. Everything in town is closed at night, even Wal-Mart is pretty weird at night, so I sort of have to stay home. This time then, was spent by me writing a letter and doing some further reading. I think that ideally, this time should be spent either writing letters or perhaps intensive study of scripture applied to personal life experiences? Something useful. Because it would be pretty silly, I think, to stay up all night on a routine basis just to play video games or something of that nature. Anyway, that's the end.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Where do flies go when it rains?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was pondering an experiment today, reckoning the death of thousands upon thousands of flies with mighty chemicals. Behind this building lodges itself prominently such a vast dumpster that you could hide two cars within itself, and inside this dumpster lies refuse and molded, rotten foods. Of course, you see that it is a haven for flies and no dirge singing will be enough to mourn them. I gnash my teeth over them in despair!

But I am talking of nothing, let me tell you what I was doing! Yes, that's it! I was pondering these flies and how I come out and they barrage me with such tidy insults, such drivel and absurdity that I barely know how to cope.

"And how are you today?", they say, weighting my shoulder with their friendly persistence. "And my what a fine bit of nose you have!", they continue, as they examine my nose in closest proximity.

"But, we are not yet acquainted!", I protest at their invasion of my personal space, and "Please do not pester me with your false pretenses!", I say...

But, nonetheless, my cries and pleas are in vain, for these neighborly parasitic flies must nosily inquire of the nature of that spot on my shirt, and even dare to touch my lips! Bagh! My arms fling in agitation, driving these bugs off for just a minute, but they are relentless in their pursuits. So I vexed myself with a solution to their problem. Their demise: My only option.

So I began a battle plan, gathering maps and organizing artillery and such. But they responded little to the threat of my loyal Beretta, so I tried chemical warfare! Ha ha! I have even now sprayed their happy home with some such liquid to become their ultimate demise for certain, and I have placed blue magic pebbles in their feeding areas, so as to be sure they will die. Die, little flies, die!

So then, I returned this morning and to my astonished eyes found not a single fly anywhere. I have won, I say! Victory is mine! Etcetera! But to my ultimate sorrow, when I returned a few hours later, they had returned--with back-up forces. "Ah, so!", said I, "It was the rain which washed away such blessed chemicals and gave you safe harbor." And so I again fed them such toxins as to remove all doubt from their insignificant minds as to the power I do indeed posses. Such deliciously tempting treats I enticed them with, to sit overnight and they would all be dead, I assure you!

But now, after all my plans have been laid, after all my schemes have been put into motion again, it started raining.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dearest,

It has been many years since I last saw you, we parted ways so quietly. Sometimes I see your face reflected in the strangers around me, that reflection reminding me of how we once were. We shared moments of anger and peace, of joy and love,  we had begun to share our hearts with each other when you went away.

Where are you now? I have heard you returned to my home town, yet I am no longer there to say how sorry I am, sorry that I let you go without a word. My trust in you, and your trust in me, was broken with those few words. And now the time has slipped by us both, separating us with a great divide of unknown memories. Who are you? Who am I? I am not the same as I was then, and you have changed also I am sure. Where did I go wrong, can you remember enough to tell me?

The past has turned into a foggy night air, clothed in mysterious drifting memories, but none of them seem right to me anymore. Another time and I would have said that you were wrong, but now I think it was me. Who are you now?

I saw your picture once, we were smiling and you had your arms around me. But that time is gone, and you and I have grown so distant that I don't even think we could return. And even now, I realize that I probably wouldn't return to you now, but I still desire one thing: Forgiveness. I lied when I said I loved you only as a sister, and that lie kept us apart when what I wanted was to be so much closer. This is my only desire, that you would find it in your heart to remember me again, only to forgive me for my childish fears. It would not be right to say I miss you, I miss what we were in those fragile memories, and we are not the same. But still I wish you the best and pray that God would keep you close to Himself,

-----Tobias S. Davis]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here I am, sitting at my computer and listening to David Crowder. But I wish for so much more, I especially wish for a dream of flying monkeys or houses I have seen before. Those are the strangest dreams. I wish for a lot of other things, but you know how it is: Can't get extremely personal on here. Wait. Sometimes I do get personal, in a strangely masked way, you will just have to grin and bear it I guess. Have you noticed how everybody wants to give the "Whats wrong with America" speech? I do. I hear it several times a day at least, "And what's wrong with whoever is this...", or "This reason is why America has gone down the tubes." and etcetera.

I just get plain silly tired of it, for this reason: Complaining doesn't fix anything. Man, I went out and voted today, how about you? I had a friend who complained about the president, but he told me he hadn't voted. That next election he complained that the president would probably be re-elected, and he was right, but I asked him later if he voted: "No, I didn't." "Well then, shut the hell up about politics."

Let me ask you something. If you have a problem with something, and it affects you, should you ignore it? No. If you have something you can do to affect that something, you should do that something. Voting may not be a very big thing, but it is something and if you won't get off your rear end and do at least something... Well, I sure won't discuss politics very willingly with you.

I think this idea can extend itself into other areas: Churches, business's, families, marriages, etcetera. You ever wonder why the divorce rate is so high? Probably because people don't think they should be burdened with the task of trying to repair something, especially if it wasn't their fault.

No, wait. Here I am, ranting about people who rant about what's wrong with other people. Hypocrisy? Maybe so. Hold on, let me think.

I realize this: There is something wrong with the world. So, let me try and fix it. No, I guess I don't know exactly what's wrong with the world. No, wait, I think I do.

Divorce is not the problem. Murder is not the problem. School shootings are just a symptom. Violence on television is not the problem. Taking creation out of the schools is not the problem. Abortion is not the problem. Gun control is not the problem. Illegal immigrants and high taxes and political unrest and high gas prices are not the problem. Those are all just symptoms of a greater "wrong", of something more than themselves.

Sin? The desire to be greater than, or the desire to reject, God? I think this is closer to the problem.

I know a solution.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello world!

My baby is undergoing surgery right now, she leaks a lot of oil so I  had to pull off the lalve cover, the  head and the  crank case to replace a load of gaskets. It took me nearly 5 hours, and now she looks a lot like a meteorite strikken motorcycle. Huge hole, is what I'm telling you. A lot of parts missing, is what I'm trying to say. Big chunk o' metal done goned bye bye and said see you later, is what I'm getting at.

I will post pictures for all the world to see when I can borrow a camera. Also, I won't be able to rebuild it until I can save up about $300, since that's what it cost's to replace all the gaskets.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is the deal: I wrote a nice little story thing for you all, it is an emotion that I have in my heart put into a story. A short story, but nice. I mean, I think it's nice. But I am going to post it for you on Sunday the 19th, which is my birthday. I just thought you all should know. For some reason.

Stay tuned for Sunday's release: "Prologue to a new generation."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, I keep getting asked if I will make it to Omaha for our little "early Thanksgiving/Birthday party", and the answer is pretty much: No. I have very little money right now, I was given a bit of money recently but since it costs me $80 to get home and back (that might even be a low estimate with prices going up) and I have a few bills coming up. So basically I am saying I can't afford it. Maybe 10 people could donate $10 each? *wink wink* Actually though, I would have to ride back almost right away since I have class on Monday. Class. Hey! I took my test the other day, Monday I will probably get the score back! Hooray!

No, seriously, I am just having trouble justifying it, what with multiple bills coming up. Do you know that my gas bill every month is almost 1/3 of my paycheck? That's pretty ridiculous, so maybe somebody wants to give a missionary a Geo? (hint Nathan hint) No, I'm kidding. Well, sort of.

Okay, so them's the plans for now. See you all later.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Tobias Davis.

Somewhere in a dream, a woman cries out, looking for what is real. And in her dream she sees a man, his hand resting gently on her shoulder, words come out of his mouth, but she can only hear his thoughts: "Wake up to real life, don't leave me here breathless waiting for your eyes to open." But she looks away into another world.

Somewhere in a dream, a woman cries out, she can't find the end of the darkened tunnel, there's a light at the end is all she knows. But a man stands beside her, his words she can hear: "Wake up to real life, I'll hold my breath forever for you." But she can't reach his opened hand, so she looks into another world.

Somewhere in a dream, a woman is looking for a door to lead to another world, a world apart from this dark and empty tunnel. She carries her burdens with her and they drag her deeper into the solitude, but there is a man lifting with all his might to free her.

But she can only barely see the outline of the man who, in her despairing imagination, has come to rescue and free her. And she fights her inner demons as they caress her with their lonely words, begging for her just to give up and let it all collapse.

Her fears are all around her, her pleasures also call her name, so she looks away from the man who stands beside her. And as she looks away, she feels a great sadness, for she feels that she is moving away from someone she should love, but she doesn't remember his face. She can't recall a time when she felt as tired as this, and there is a bed, and there is a pillow, and a blanket. Soft cushions, covered in silk, invite her to lie down and sleep. But the man softly grips her shoulders, speaking in a quiet voice: "Wake up to this real world, to real life, return to me. I will wait forever for you."

The man stands quietly, seeing how she won't let go, and he holds her hand closer still to his heart.

Some doctors walk by, pretending not to notice what takes place in that hospital room for hours every day. A man stands by a woman's bed, quietly speaking to her, begging her to awake: "Wake up to me, to real life, I'll never let go. Wake up to me, wake up to me, I'll wait forever for you."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Final exams and promises.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately I have been pondering this one thing a lot: Why can't I completely stop sinning? If I stopped the one sin I am in now, it will just be another sin that haunts me, and I lack the power to stop. So, I have begun a prayer, that God would keep me from temptation, that He would deliver me.

Monday I took my final exam for Calculus 1. It is the only class I took, although next semester I hope to take three classes. I had maintained an "A" average throughout the class, except for one test where my head felt like cotton and I failed miserably. I don't recal failing a test before, so this was such a shock to me that I sat stunned through the entire class.

Anyway, I found out that if I got an "A+" on all following tests, I would recieve a "B+", tops. So, in taking the final exam, I am sure that I got all of them right except one question. Now that I think about it, I am pretty sure I got it right, but I can't remember the original question. For a while, I thought I got it wrong, but now I am thinking I got it right. Tomorrow I will know for sure.

Christmas plans are as follows: Leaving here on the 19th, really late at night, driving to Eppley Airport and dropping off a friend. Then, driving home and probably sleeping a little, even though it will be about 7:30 am. Or, maybe not sleeping? Maybe early breakfast with some friends? Anyway, I will be staying in the vicinity of Omaha for about a week before returning, so anybody wanting to hang out with a cool guy, write me a comment / send me an a-mail / call me / write me a letter. Nathan and I are probably going to work on a project for a while, and I would like to spend some quality time with a few certain friends and my older siblings, other than that I am just relaxing. Getting some quality family time.

Last, the promise: I have been doing some creative writing, some brainstorming for an idea for a larger story I am working on now. So, in the process I have written some short story material which I won't really use, including the next part of "Prologue to a new generation", which I hope to post before this weeks end.

		<title>The snow has never been more beautiful.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Outside the window of my house, sixteen inches of snow cover the ground. It's like a big canopy has lain itself over everything, except the trees have snow and you couldn't really compare the snow heavy on the branches to cloth. Except you could say that the trees are heavily covered with a blanket of snow, or something similar at least.

Yesterday it snowed, it snowed a few days before that and none of it had melted yet. Yesterday's snow was the most surreal thing I have seen, the snow itself fell practically straight down since the wind had decided to visit another state, and the flakes were real flakes. Now listen while I say this: The snowflakes I have seen in the past were always more like pebbles or odd shaped crystal lattices interwoven, but these snowflakes, ah! Snowflakes half as big as a penny, drifting straight down into my hand, and when I looked at them they looked exactly like the paper cut-outs you see around Christmas time. I don't even know how to describe my feelings, I have never ever <em>ever</em> seen <em>real</em> snowflakes. I wish I had some camera that I could take a macro photo of them to show you! I am ecstatic about real snowflakes!

But the snow turned out to be deadly: On my way to school today I saw four vehicles had lost control and were still stuck in the middle of the road. One of them was a semi truck, loaded down with some huge metal object. Another had rolled over and the roof was partly crushed. Even more, on Saturday night the snow turned out to be the agent of death: A wonderful woman and two of her children were killed in a rollover on the interstate, her son is in critical condition and her husband is having a hard time with it. I personally didn't know this family very well, but they were members of my local church.

Beautiful snowflakes, so symmetric,
your thoughtful shape is quite pedantic.
And even now you look romantic,
while death you bring, so acapnotic.
Weirded out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here is the deal folks, I am in classes: Physics and Calculus 2. I am setting into motion various plans for the end of the summer, for schooling, housing, job, etc... So far I have come up with a couple ideas for housing, one of them being to purchase a "fixer-upper" in Lincoln, renovate it and rent some of the rooms out to pay for taxes, loan fees, utilities, etc... Problem with this is that Lincoln doesn't have much for "fixer-uppers" in the four bedroom or larger size, and even those are 8.0x10^4 dollars or so. The other thing I have been contemplating is to live with my older brother and his family, they have a large basement area which would really work out well I think, and I don't mind the kids. Here is another thing going on: I am trying to get a vehicle. My jeep is basically crapped out, transmission wise, and I would like something more fuel efficient for school anyway, something like a Geo Metro or Ford Festiva would be great. Also, when I do move to Lincoln, if I purchase a house and renovate it, I would need a pick-up truck quite often, so I might as well find a small one now I guess. Ooh! What I really want is a Ford Ranger, 1983! Bam sucka!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was riding back home from archery tonight when I looked up and saw the moon lighting up the sky, a majestic halo of colors stemmed out from it. It was like looking up at a rainbow that was in outer space; I felt like perhaps I was taking part of a science fiction story where the earth is being terraformed. But one thing that really struck me while I was looking was the red halo that was made up of clouds. Imagine for a minute the evening sky, when all the clouds are lit up in deep red, where the clouds have begun to look like they really are red, that they always were red. That color was "reflected" in the thin, wispy clouds of this evening, only, it was in a halo shape.

This reminded me of a rainbow, a rainbow that we can see in the sky at night by the bright moonlight. And then I was reminded of the promise God made in the Old Testament, where He spoke to Noah after the flood and said that never again would he destroy the earth this way, then God gave them a sign. Remember? It was the rainbow, that amazing thing you see sometimes in the spring rain and in the hose spray during summer and when you fly in an airplane you can look down on the rainbow and see it as a complete circle. Except this time I saw it up in the sky, surrounding the moon. It was the most beautiful thing I have seen in a long time. It was the most beautiful thing I have seen since I last saw her. That woman whose mystery calls out to me and I can't even remember her name.

This circle of light reminds me of a promise God has made, which in turn reminds me of other promises He has made, all of which he is faithful to fulfill.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have some of those glasses which separate the world into blue and red. They are supposed to give certain images a three-dimensional layer. This works best on images which have been converted to black and white, using the red/blue layers to create dimension. These glasses are cheap, but they do alright.

I have an idea which I am testing out. At 1:30AM. Basically I put the glasses on backwards, noticing that when I was done, the general eye fatigue effect made one eye to accenuate red and the other blue. What I am hoping for is that when I take these specs off my face, the residual effect of eye fatigue will allow me to see the 3D images. Since I placed tham on backwards, I anticipate that the inverse effect is what I will see. I am presently looking for a black and white image to test this on...

I found one which really hurts my eyes looking through the lenses reversed. Now, I am removing the lenses, hoping that the residual effect will be three-dimensional without the glasses on.

It did not work at all. In fact, when I looked at the picture without the lenses on, it was perhaps even more disorienting than with them on and reversed. That was mildly dissapointing...]]></content:encoded>

I have to run the sound system, and I think that God has placed me in the room on purpose since practically everything talked about so far has hit me right on the nose. Or the head.

		<title>The Golden Compass, or, His Dark Materials (Philip Pullman)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a review on the philosophy behind the movie "The Golden Compass", based on the book trilogy "His Dark Materials" (or "Northern Lights" in the UK) which was written by Philip Pullman.

I first heard of this movie/book when I heard Bill Donahue of the Catholic League put out a short video (available <a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/videos/?video=11">here</a>) condemning the upcoming movie. Today, however, I happened upon the book in a local bookstore and, in about two hours, read about 300 pages of the last book, and I found myself absolutely riveted to the story. Well written, well built characters, and good details.

One thing that did stick out about the entire story was its very strong anti-God message. Not just that God did not exist, but that God <em>does</em> exist and needs to be killed. This idea, stems from Pullmans staunch atheism, and is part of the recent movement of that group to label Christianity as not only unbelievable, but also dangerous. As this was my first Philip Pullman book, I was surprised to see his unrelenting attack on God's character.

The main issue I have heard so far is that the boy and girl (Will and Lyra) end up killing God; however, that should not be the primary cause for concern. The more problematic thing was the absolute contempt for God, that the writing causes the reader to despise God. In very subtle, and sometimes not so subtle ways, Pullman writes wondrous pictures of how God is causing problems.

In one example, God created a land of the dead, where both believers and non-believers go to be tormented when they die. He appointed tormentors, flying creatures called "harpies", to scream ridicule and fear into people and slowly "drain them of life". Eventually, it is revealed that Gods purpose for the harpies was to get satisfaction from looking for the bad things. The main characters release them from that command and suddenly the harpies are better, even saving Lyra's life in one section.

Pullman brilliantly creates a very visual representation of what he thinks of God: God creates bad things, but people can make them good. If this simple idea were presented explicitly, it would be easy to recognize, but Pullman presents these ideas in such a subtle way that it is only by reflection and meditation that I realized the author's purpose. Pullman shows his expertise, not only as a captivating writer, but as a highly skilled brain-twister.

If my words were not enough to convince you, consider a quote directly from the author: "My books are about killing God", and also that he was "trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief."

The book is obviously anti-Catholic, but highly anti-Christian as well. The main organization in the book, The Magesterium, is obviously a play off of the Catholic Church, complete with monks and bishops. Pullman's depiction of religion in general is clearly anti-Christian-God, as opposed to, for example, Buddha or Allah.

I thought the story was absolutely riveting, however, it's mind-bending God-hate makes it very annoying to read. It is not something I would suggest reading for the pleasure, since trying to skim past all the bad philosophy is a continual process. It would be like an elaborate theater production, where you realize that they are ridiculing and mocking you throughout the whole thing: Why would you watch it?

This ends my review of the book, now I will say some words about the movie:

Here's how the producer is hoping everything goes down: The movie comes out during the Christmas shopping season. It doesn't say anything really theologically or philosophically questionable, so parents will probably think its okay. Kids will probably love it and fall for it like they fell for Harry Potter. Parents will then buy the books for their kids as Christmas presents.

This is an excellent business plan, since it would likely get huge book sales. However, the whole of Christiandom is up in arms because they see this not as a brilliant sales technique, but as a brilliant political move to get kids to read the books in order to brainwash them.

Whether it's for sales, or for brainwashing, I don't care. What I hope parents realize is that, by buying a child a book, you are practically endorsing the thoughts of the book. Too often I see parents doing this without actually reading or reading <em>about</em> the book. In many cases it has not been seriously harmful; however, in this case I think it would be <em>very</em> harmful for a Christian parent to endorse this book by giving it to their kids.

So, all I am saying is this: Would you buy a book that ridiculed you consistently? Maybe if it was funny, but probably not if it was serious. Likewise, I would not suggest purchasing this book. Read it if you want, but be sure to realize the crafted ideas are entirely anti-God and anti-Christian.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nebraska Legislative Bill 1141 (LB1141)</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2008/02/11/legislative-bill-lb1141/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is my second attempt at a review on Nebraska Legislative Bill 1141, introduced by Senator Schimek on January 23, 2008. A full version of the bill is available at the Nebraska Legislative site. My first review I lost somewhere, which is unfortunate for me, but after some discussion I think I can simplify the review. So my loss is your gain, perhaps.

Legislative Bill 1141 is a bill highly fought by the home schooling crowd, and with good reason. Many people I know have argued that the bill is a good idea because it introduces accountability of home schools. They then usually point out that one home schooling student, whose parents didn't seem to care enough to do it right. Of course, in response to the latter argument, I can easily point out a dozen public school students, known personally, who were schooled very poorly in a public school. Because I am sure we could go around all day, pointing out what's wrong with public or private or home school programs, allow me to argue why I think the bill is wrong.

<strong>Reason #1: It is poorly written.</strong>

If a bill can easily be interpreted to multiple conclusions, it is poorly written and represents a dangerous issue: If it is passed, it has the potential to create bad results. This is, in every way, a likely results if LB 1141 is passed. It is written in a poor manner, allowing easy interpretation to say things as crazed as home school parents must be public schooled or minimally have college degrees or take college level classes in every subject they teach. The bill also allows the interpretation that, if a parent doesn't meet up to <em>all</em> the bills requirements, the parent and child can be prosecuted, leading to potential Social Services takeover of the family.

Of course, many of the "worst-case-scenario" interpretations would require interpretation of the law, and do not directly stem from it. However, I am a very firm believer that a poorly written bill should be struck down, even if it purposes to do something good.

<strong>Reason #2: It makes home schooling economically infeasible.</strong>

The bill requires the use of State approved curriculum, equipment, and facilities. In this way, the State can require the parent to not only purchase/use the same books, but it also requires a parent to have equipment comparable to a public school. This can include physics equipment, telescopes, shop class tools, microscopes, electronic equipment, etc.

Additionally, the annual (or more frequently, another poorly written section) testing and paperwork filing and processing is billed to the parents. This idea is ridiculous to me: A home schooling parent already pays property taxes and other taxes which exist solely to fund the public schools, they do not receive a tax refund for not utilizing the public school, and they are expected to pay <em>additional</em> fees above and beyond what a public schooled student is expected to pay.

<strong>Reason #3: It will create more taxes and bureaucracy.</strong>

Parents of home schools will be required to turn in mountains of paperwork to demonstrate that their children are being trained according to State regulations. Parents will also be required to turn in paperwork to demonstrate that they have had "formal education," that they have taken classes directly related to the things they are teaching, and that they are following the curriculum requirements. Also, thorough testing of the home schooled students must be done, and this accompanied by a rather lengthy review of the student written by the tester.

None of the government paper pushers mentioned above exists. None of the buildings needed to store these people, their papers, their testing equipment, filing their papers, etc. exist. To put it very simply: None of these things exist. This means that, quite unlike adding to an existing infrastructure, new buildings, new office workers, new testing employees, new computer systems, and new everything will need to be organized and built. You can expect that this organization will need its own facilities, since the number of home schools is increasing rapidly.

<strong>Reason #4: It is not needed, and was not requested.</strong>

So far as I have been able to find out, the bill was not requested by anyone in particular, nor has anyone been hammering on Senator Schimeks door for any similar bill. This is usually the case when a law maker has some pet project, or is quietly lobbied by big organizations such as the National Department of Education. This bill does not represent the public's desire, that is, the public has not said that such a bill was necessary.

Further, I would posit that the bill is unnecessary because home schooled students do at least as well, if not better, on average than public schooled students. I certainly have bias on this remark, but allow me to point to a significant study done by Dr. Brian Ray, titled "<em>Strengths of TheirOwn: Home Schoolers Across America.</em>" This was written in 1997, but was a study of over 5,000 home school students, and found them, on the average, to out-perform public school students by 30 to 37 percent. That report is not available online, however, a 1998 study is available <a href="http://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v7n8/">here</a>, and says many similarly good things about home school students.

Similarly, a 2004 study (available <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3955/is_200404/ai_n9383889">here</a>) shows that home school students perform at least as good when entering college as their counterpart public school students.

In all, the major argument for the necessity of this bill comes from the fact of the occasional home school student whose parents did not work very hard at educating the child. However, I would argue that there are at least as many (by percentage) public school students who remain in a similarly "poor educated" state and, I would argue, the percentage of public school students who have no desire to learn is aberrantly high when compared to home schooled students.

<strong>Reason #5: It kills home schooling efforts, in practicality.</strong>

One of the major reasons for home school success rests on the fact that a home school is not required to teach in a specific manner. This breeds new ideas, efficiency of teaching, and better curriculum. Further, another reason for success is that home schooled students are not taught in a necessarily sequential manner. This idea is very foreign to many public school students, however, it is one of the bigger reasons for success.

LB 1141 requires sequential schooling, with State approved curriculum and equipment, thus in effect making home schooling the same as public schooling. This point, I feel, needs to be hammered in a bit more: The biggest difference between a public school and a home school is in the curriculum and the method of teaching. To require the curriculum and teachingmethod to be the same as a public school is tantamount to requiring home schooled students to attend a public school.

<strong>Reason #6: It creates a disparity between public/home school consequence.</strong>

If a home schooled student fails to pass the evaluation (technically, there is not "test" to pass, just a set of unbounded evaluations; another reason to call it a poorly written bill) they are required to be sent to a public school, or the parents and children are both prosecuted with truancy laws.

Now, stop. Evaluate the previous statement. Just ask one thing: If a public schooled student doesn't pass an annual State test, are they required to go to a private school? The answer is a seemingly obvious No, however, public school students are routinely "passed" through a class without proper knowledge. Further, NO public school student is required to take a similar evaluation, so it creates a stricter requirement for a home schooled student.

This, and other requirements and consequential results of non-compliance, make a unique situation where a public schooled student would never find themselves: Upon failing a class, you are required to go to a private school or face prosecution. This is what I call an injustice to home schooled students, and a disparity in the law.

In summary, I would like to point out a few other ideas: It is presently a legally allowed practice to home school your children. We who home school or would like to do so when we have children need to be involved in educating the general public on why home schooling is a good idea. We also need to help home schools to be constantly evaluating their students; to be sure they are learning at a sufficient rate. We cannot prevent people from thinking poorly of home schooling, but we can limit their reasons to control our educational practices. By assuring quality education to our own children, we are doing our parental duty and reassuring the public of our aptitude.

Lastly, for those who understand the necessity of home schooling, please (please please please please) join the Home Schooling Legal Defense, any local Home Schooling groups, and help out your fellow home schools by encouraging them regularly. It is a lot of work, and the HSLDA provides a great service to protect your rights.

That is all.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Tobias, I just wanted to say that after reading your review, I thought you had some good points.  I still don't agree with you on some things such as:<br/>1) Public School students take standardized tests all the time, which home-schoolers don't have to take, so home-schoolers taking one that public schoolers don't have to take should be no big deal.<br/>2) Nobody is saying that the public school system is perfect, but if someone doesn't understand the class well enough, they usually fail.  True, some people cheat, but that's not the majority.<br/>3) It makes me nervous to know that there are children in our country which being home schooled and taught subjects by people who really aren't qualified to teach such classes.  It's a shame that home schoolers don't get to use a lot of the same equipment that public school children have access to.  I think that most home school students shouldn't take higher level courses at home, they should take them at some sort of institution with a qualified individual.  This isn't an attack on homeschooling parents, it's just not practical.  I don't know as much about physics as a teacher, who had been teaching about it for years, would.  I don't even like the fact that most substitute teachers aren't really qualified to teach their subjects. <br/>4)I don't see what's so wrong about learning from these things: <br/>[The great homosexuals in history, early lesbian writers, the great merits of socialism, the evils of European colonization, what they can do to save the whales the atmosphere and the planet, the importance of not flushing your toilet every time.]<br/>You can learn a lot from people, even if they're wrong.<br/>5) This final little comment you left seemed to be pretty unnecessary.  Nobody said that public school is perfect, but neither is home school.  I could make a list of all the problems with home school, but I don't.  It's not necessary or polite.  Why can't we all try helping each other out instead of viciously attacking one another?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would like to reply to the previous comment:<br/><br/>1) This bill requires homeschools to grade the same and teach essentially the same material, so a test would not be necessary, as you could just look at the child's grades/portfolio. But I guess the bill does provide for that. But I do agree with Tobias that if homeschools are required to do all the same things that public school does, homeschooling kind of loses its point.<br/><br/>2) The problem is that the bill doesn't say "if the student receives a failing score," it says "if the student does not score equal." I don't really know what that means, which makes me wonder if it could be interpreted as a requirement for homeschoolers to score at least average compared to other students their age. Also, when a student fails a class in public school, the teacher does not lose the right to teach that student - they merely see the student in class again next year. Why not allow the same for homeschools?<br/><br/>Also, I don't know if public schools have changed how they grade in elementary school since I was a student, but when I was in school it was very rare that a student would be held back, and I'm sure that not all of those students who moved ahead tested "equal" in all subjects.<br/><br/>3) Many homeschools, with regard to the more challenging classes, form cooperative efforts to teach small groups of homeschoolers, which gives them access to more knowledgable teachers and equipment. That being said, I can't say that I feel more intelligent for having used a microscope in high school biology class.<br/><br/>In high school, many homeschoolers take difficult material through college courses.<br/><br/>Also, one of the greatest benefits to homeschooling is that it teaches students to be self-teachers. Public school does a great disservice in making students utterly dependent on the teacher's ability as a teacher and knowledge of a subject. I think it's easy for public schoolers to blame a teacher for their poor performance in a subject; I've never heard a homeschooler make such claims, even once they go to college. They are more likely to find and use resources to learn in spite of a lack of a quality teacher.<br/><br/>That is such a valuable skill to have, because once you get out of college, to succeed in business you often have to learn new things, and having to attend a class or rely on a coworker to teach you everything you need to know would be cumbersome.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[mr. piro,<br/>You are right, on reflection I realized my comment was foolish as it distracts from the actual review of the bill and the importance of the thing at hand. I apologize.<br/><br/>Allow me to respond to your points:<br/><br/>1) I don't really have a problem with home schooled students taking a standardized test. In fact, whether the law requires it, they should be <i>already</i> to be sure they are teaching at a reasonable rate. My disagreement arises from the disparity of consequence upon failure of such a test.<br/><br/>2) I should clarify to say that I am not trying to say home schooling is perfect, I myself have seen one or two failures. My attempt was to debunk the argument of "I know a home schooled student who doesn't know anything, therefore home schooling needs regulations." Additional regulations have not helped turn around the failing academia of the public school, and should not be used in an attempt to prevent failure at a home school.<br/><br/>3) I think I understand your concern, however, what makes a person qualified to teach a high-school level course? Actually, many home schooling parents hire tutors to help teach certain subjects which are not well understood. Also, many home schools group together to share facilities and equipment to make the education less costly and easier to manage. Additionally, I have heard of home schooling groups where parents will help teach other parents children, if they know the subject matter better.<br/><br/>The real point is this: Home schooling works great because the parents have the freedom to teach without restriction on what and when. It breeds competition: Perhaps you have found a way to teach algebra in two months, or have found an easier way to teach astronomy. It creates community: If several families get together, perhaps they can purchase that $2K microscope. I don't know my history very well, but Mrs so-and-so does, perhaps we can share teaching responsibility.<br/><br/>In fact, it has such a multitude of benefits that, even if the public school in my area were exceptional, I would still be home schooling my children.<br/><br/>Clearly there are families who do not get involved to such an extent as my idealistic model just presented, however, it does happen, and it happens not because the government restricts it, but because the parents care.<br/><br/>Obviously, you may have parents who are pitiful enough to home school their children only for lazy reasons, and so produce poor students. However, this bill does not address such a scenario, and instead addresses the issue of whether a teacher is State approved/accredited.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>I Have Never Taken Psychotropics.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a very strange thing to tell you, it involves me hallucinating: Last weekend, on Friday, I took a Calculus exam. For those who care, which I count as a maximum of two, it was on critical points and double integration. I had a good time, but I am not sure I got all the answers right. I won't get back my test until tomorrow, so who knows?

I digress: After I took the exam, I walked back to the student hang-out area to do some more studying and this is what happened: I saw everything in math. It was very "trippy". It was not at all like that moment in "A Beautiful Mind" where Russel Crowe plays the brilliant mathematician John Nash, and you see a screen of scrolling numbers and functions and etc. The best way I could describe it is like this: If you learn a foreign language (which I haven't, being American) you reach a point where you no longer need to consciously translate that language into your native tongue, and it becomes subconscious.

This subconscious thing is what was happening. My brain was taking what I saw around me and translating it to math and then to English. Or something. I don't really know, it was just really wild. Later that night my brother and I were talking politics, but I kept hearing everything he said as functions of multiple variables, constrained to certain points... It was very distracting, and difficult to follow him. Later that night, I had dreams of mathematics. Integrals over functions with ten thousand variables and streams of thought following constraints of multiple functions.

I won't lie. It was awesome.

Now I am back to normal, and I am seeing the world as it normally is. It's kind of disappointing, actually. I was hoping I would turn into one of those savant mathematicians... Rats.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Confessions of a Lunatic, Part 2.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Where is the beginning of a story, of this story? Could I say it began at my birth? At my many points of drastic change? I think this story begins at the end of another story which I read so many years ago. I have heard it said that a good story starts with the love of a woman, but I think it starts with love. Just love.

And so, this story begins with love, love for a person, a child, written in a book most people called "fiction". I don't want to tell you the name of this book (most of you have never heard of it) because I feel that it is a secret, an intimate secret. It is intimate because I fell in love with a child who only existed in pages, a child no one knows, but who I know.

And I don't tell anyone about this because I don't think they will understand what I mean. I desperately want someone to say "I know what you mean, and I am lonely also." I am lonely because this child is not here, but every child I see reminds me a little of him.

You ask me why I love this child? It is because he taught me wat it means to love, he taught me the value of life and innocence, he taught me how to be alive.

This is my secret. This is my confession. I have let a child capture my heart, knowing he would leave, and now I am alone.

Where are you?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this is a short update to all my friends and readers. I was on a panel for a public forum on Intelligent Design (ID) versus Evolution, which admittedly has it's limitations for a Christian, and so I spent an entire week studying up on everything, preparing an 11 page argument from the ground up, sweating and pouring everything into it.

It turns out I didn't need to bother, since the evolution side was not only crippled in their arguments (only one person had time to prepare), and by the fact that one of their party didn't show up (still don't know why), and by the fact that the main speaker mumbled a lot (sorry Clint, but I couldn't hear you sometimes), but by the fact that one of the panelists didn't take the forum seriously, didn't take the arguments seriously, and treated the entire thing as a joke.

So basically, I think that the ID side made a good presentation, making logical arguments and so on. Of course, I am a bit biased, but it gets better: The school newspaper (the Daily Nebraskan) published an Opinion article today, you can read it <a href="http://www.dailynebraskan.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=2e3703c2-c70e-478c-9de2-7324454eee0a">here</a>, which had my sides splitting with laughter. The online versions last couple sentences are slightly different than the paper version, but the digital is funnier. I will quote it for you:
<blockquote>At the forum, Tobias Davis, a sophomore biological engineering major, said: "It's reasonable to infer design on biological systems."
No it isn't. But doesn't he sound convincing?</blockquote>
If that is not the most sound argument I have ever heard, I really don't know what is. I should tell that to my math teacher when I get back my exam scores:
"It's reasonable to infer you didn't study."
"No it isn't. But don't you sound convincing."

You seriously need to read the rest of that piece, it is sad but side splittingly hilarious! I don't even know where to begin! Even the evolutionists thought the article was bad, read the long comment by Rory Larson, <a href="http://www.dailynebraskan.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticleComments&amp;ustory_id=2e3703c2-c70e-478c-9de2-7324454eee0a#e86ec223-8698-42f1-9b7c-664fc4810286">here</a>, about five pages down.

Anyway, thanks for your prayers. I was able to record most of it, I think, but the video editor machine wasn't working today so you will have to wait till next week to see it on YouTubes or whatever.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Law and Liberty (Rousas J Rushdoony)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dramatic lines of theological brilliance, but if they do not change the heart what is the purpose?

In reading Rushdoony's "Law and Liberty" I have come across the most clear argument for Christians to <span style="font-style: italic;">strongly</span> impact the legislation process. Essentially Rushdoony refutes the argument implied by the statement "Morality cannot be legislated." While this has some merit of truth, in that the law itself cannot make someone a better person, it is actually a lie.

Morality is always being legislated. If a law is passed making murder illegal, this is a moral law legislated. The law which prohibits theft is a moral decision of which there can be no escape. If you were to pass a law restricting Islamic law from being taught in schools, whether for Christian means or for secular anti-religion means, this would be a case of legislated morality. That is specifically, a moral law has been legislated.

The myth that humanism has propagated is that there are some laws which are entirely neutral, and do not stem from a sense of morality. Morality comes from religious beliefs, whether theistic atheistic or otherwise. In this sense humanism is a "shadow religion", that is, it is a religion which claims to <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be a religion. Humanisms morality does not come from God, but it comes from the invented god of self.

Why do you suppose that, in the Old Testament, the Israelites were always<span style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">worshiping handmade idols</span></span>? It is because, when man has rejected the <span style="font-style: italic;">absolute truth</span>, man must make up some truth of it's own. Whether that be golden figurines, stone statues, specific people, or humans as a whole which are claimed to have power, the first step is <span style="font-style: italic;">rejection of God's law</span>.

Humanistic law (based on humanism strictly) is made to <span style="font-style: italic;">save</span> the people. This is why it promises that, if only they can pass the right laws or fund the right people, culture will be restored and poverty will be eliminated and there will be no more war. But we as Christians should know that <span style="font-style: italic;">the law cannot save</span>, and further that <span style="font-style: italic;">man's heart cannot be changed by law alone</span>. As Rushdoony points out, "we all slow down a bit when we see a patrol car on the highway", but it is not the <span style="font-style: italic;">heart</span> that is changed: The person goes back to speeding when the patrol car is gone.

The statement of "you cannot legislate morality" is an obfuscation of the more correct statement of "law will not change a persons heart". But that is not the scriptural reason for the law, instead, the laws purpose is as a <span style="font-style: italic;">restraint</span> to evil. By fining and jailing those who speed we restrain those who would drive recklessly at dangerous speeds. This is a concept which needs to be realized more by Christian and non-Christian alike: The law's purpose is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">restrain evil</span>.

I encourage everyone to read <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> by Rushdoony.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sanctity of Life and the Death Penalty</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finished reading chapter two of Rushdoony's amazing book "<a href="http://chalcedon.edu/search/?query=law+and+liberty">Law and Liberty</a>" (I recommend you forgo whatever luxury you had planned and buy it NOW) which is about the sanctity of life. These are some thoughts I had in reflection:

The thought I have heard repeated, in Christian as well as secular circles, is that the death penalty is wrong because "life is sacred" and killing, being the taking of life, is outright wrong. The reason is altogether humanistic: Life is sacred, humans are alive (have life), killing is taking life, and therefore killing is always wrong. Some type of reasoning is to be found in all cases, and yields such views as: All wars are outright wrong (no just wars), Animals have a valid claim to life equally with humans, and, No matter how bad a crime might be it is not acceptable to have the death penalty.

Rushdoony references a case where the father of a six year-old girl (the girl being "brutally slain by a sex pervert") said, "I can't blame the man as much as the society which produced him." This un-Biblical reasoning is the exact mindset which <span style="font-style: italic;">by necessity</span> flows from a human centered philosophy. The Bible clearly says that we are either enslaved to Christ or Sin, and those who have rejected Christ are chained to sinful mindsets, in the previous case a mindset of irresponsibility specifically. That is, the other-persons-fault mindset which is <span style="font-style: italic;">absurdly</span> prevalent in America is a fault of <span style="font-style: italic;">each individual</span> refusing to take responsibility for their own action and dissatisfaction.

To return from that brief rabbit trail, the real issue is this: Killing (all killing) is prohibited in such law as God has given: "Who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" <span style="font-size: 85%;">(Gen. 9:6)</span>, "He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall surely be put to death" <span style="font-size: 85%;">(Ex. 21:12)</span>, "The murderer shall be put to death" <span style="font-size: 85%;">(Num. 35:16-18)</span> etc... However, to outright say that God has forbidden <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> killing is absurd, but rather, the authority of killing is God's alone and He has delegated it in specific ways to the government. I do not think that, when Romans 13 says the government "does not bear the sword in vain", it will only use the sword as some shiny distraction, but rather as killing judgement.

No killing (taking of life) is allowed except by what authority God has given, in specific cases of transgressing <span style="font-style: italic;">God's</span> law. For example, taking someones life without God's scriptural authorization <span style="font-style: italic;">requires</span> that said person be killed. In fact, as Rushdoony points out, if a magistrate<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>fails to enact <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the laws (in this case, I refer to the <span style="font-style: italic;">law</span> of capital punishment) they are in rebellion to God, and "even their prayers will be an abomination." <span style="font-size: 85%;">(Prov. 28:9)</span> However, this should be some comfort, since this absolutely forbids "sins" against the state being punishable by death, something that is happening in various forms even now, <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> crimes punishable by death are crimes against <span style="font-style: italic;">God</span> foremost.

This is why there is <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">no</span></span> contradiction in being against abortion and for the death penalty: God has required of us to use the death penalty, and also required of us to defend human life. I am absolutely pro-life and I support the death penalty. This is not an idea the humanist can truly understand, since they already reject God's definition of life, and they reject God's law.

Further, as Rushdoony states, "man proven guilty cannot be the object of pity". That is, if a person is rightly convicted of some sin deserving the death penalty, we cannot have pity on them in any way. Rushdoony says it best: "Those who are full of pity for the guilty criminal are themselves men who have forsaken the law. Their pity for the criminal is itself a sign of depravity."

"They that forsaketh the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them." Proverbs 28:4

How many times have you praised the works of those who are wicked (MTV, Heretical churches, Planned Parenthood, Hollywood, the ACLU, etc.)? You yourself are displaying that <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">you have rejected the law</span></span>. It is not myself who judges your heart, but God above knows if you are on the side of the wicked. I have praised the works of wicked men in the past, and I repent of it.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David,<br/>Thank you for your comment, Rushdoony is a very amazing person.<br/><br/>Dudleysharp,<br/>Please do not "link bomb" on blogs or forums, it is generally considered bad taste. "Link bombing" refers to an overwhelming number of links (in your case 20+) with no stated relevancy to the forum/blog post. While your numbered links may be considered acceptable (although you may want to cut it down to 3-6), the last set of links has <i>no</i> information with it, and is not user-friendly.<br/><br/>That being said, you state that a religious position is not necessary to justify the death penalty. While I understand that there are multiple logical arguments for the death penalty aside from scriptural arguments, <i>your</i> argument <i>still</i> comes from a religious backing, even though it claims religious indifference: The belief that human derived logic is a legitimate overriding rule. It is interesting also that you post many links to the Roman church, a definite religious group.<br/><br/>This is not the case: Human derived logical arguments, such as given by <a HREF="http://www.domid.blogspot.com/2007/05/amerio-on-capital-punishment.html" REL="nofollow">Romano Amerio</a> and others, are <i>absolutely insufficient</i> since they end up relying on an argument parallel to "My belief is right." In this case, as in the case of <i>all</i> human-derived logical cases of the death penalty, you will never have a system which is just.<br/><br/>One extreme of humanism-based death penalty is Hitler's Nazism, where innocent people were judged as worthy of death. However, the other pacifist extreme is that even the guilty are not worthy of death. Both cases are an affront and rejection of God's law.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Reading this reminds me of how much I miss conversations of this nature.  I don't want to say that my friends are unintelligent, but they aren't curious learners...and I lack such enriching influences in my life.  Anyway, I felt a bit of disagreement on some points, but overall loved this post.  I can't remember the first disagreement, but the second was at the end.  It was said that to feel sympathy towards the criminal is only because you're guilty yourself (in essence).  To this I must protest.  Even God in all of His righteousness is compassionate and merciful to the insubordinate.  I just donâ€™t think it should be assumed that compassion toward the sinner is because you directly relate to that particular sin.  Iâ€™m quite tired, and unsure if Iâ€™m expressing myself well.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Renae (Parker?),<br/>I understand the difficulty in the "no sympathy" idea: I myself am not sure that I agree with Rushdoony's statement. I think that, if you state it correctly, his thought is correct: We should not feel a certain <i>type</i> of sympathy, that is, we should not feel that it is terrible that he must be punished. The law (rules and punishments) are there to insure liberty, so the punishment should be as sure as the rule itself. I agree that it is a difficult idea, I must think of it more.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The main issue I have with the death penalty is that I think it provides too little compensation for the victim's family and loved ones. How much does it assuage their pain and loss if all they receive is the satisfaction that the man/woman who did it is no longer on this earth?<br/>I think a very long period or even life of servitude to the victim's family would be ideal. It obviously doesn't repay the full debt, but I feel it would repay more than simply killing the offender would.<br/>It would also flow more smoothly with Christ's message of love and forgiveness.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lance,<br/>In what way should a family be compensated for the loss? If your father were killed, would monetary gain be something to appease the pain? I would think not. Of course, putting to death the one who murdered might not appease the pain either.<br/><br/>The real issue is this: We must do as God commands, in all areas of life, even if we do not immediately see the benefit. The death penalty is required by scripture, although provisions could be made, and so it must be followed.<br/><br/>That is my argument. Not what I feel would be right, but what God says is right in the scriptures. It is not easy to deal with, but it is right.<br/><br/>Thanks for your comments.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tobias:<br/><br/>Why I Support Capital Punishment<br/>Andrew Tallman <br/>http://andrewtallmanshowarticles.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-i-support-capital-punishment-part-1.html    (a series of 10)<br/><br/>"If Jesus elsewhere opposes capital punishment, then He is not only contradicting the Father but even His own words. "<br/><br/>"Typically, (the anti death penalty) view is that the harsh and mean God the Father of the Old Testament established execution, but the loving and kind God the Son of the New Testament abolished it."<br/><br/>"Iâ€™m pretty sure such people donâ€™t realize theyâ€™re denying the Trinity when they say this."<br/><br/>"The doctrine of the Trinity affirms the eternal unity of all three persons of the Godhead, but such a fundamental disagreement between the Son and the Father would rupture this unity. In fact, if Jesus had contradicted any of the Fatherâ€™s principles, let alone such a well-established one, that very disagreement would have immediately disproved His claims to be the divine Son."<br/><br/>"This was exactly the heresy the Pharisees were hoping to trap Him into when they brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus. Even His enemies knew that He absolutely had to affirm capital punishment in order to prove Himself not a false prophet. "<br/><br/>"How truly strange, then, that those who claim to love Him assert that He did exactly what His enemies failed to trick Him into doing! Far from opposing capital punishment, Jesus actually advocated it, as His unity with the Father required."<br/><br/>"Matthew 5:17-18â€œDo not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.â€ <br/><br/>"Just a few verses later, He extends the prohibition against murder to hatred and condemns haters to â€œthe hell of fireâ€ in verse 22, which is very strange talk for someone who opposes capital punishment. Itâ€™s very hard to dismiss these verses because they occur smack in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, which is so often mistakenly offered as the repudiation of Old Testament justice."<br/><br/>"Later, Jesus scolds the Pharisees and scribes for teaching leniency toward rebellious children by quoting the Old Testament, â€œFor God said, â€˜Honor your father and mother,â€™ and â€˜He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.â€™â€ (Matthew 15:4)"<br/><br/>"Subsequently, when the Romans come to arrest Jesus, Peter rather ineptly tries to defend Him by killing Malchus, but only succeeds in slicing off his ear. Jesus rebukes him with the warning, â€œPut your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.â€ Far from advocating pacifism, as this passage is often misused to do, Jesus here teaches Peter that using the sword (for murder) will only get the sword used against him (for execution)."<br/><br/>"Shortly thereafter, Jesus tells Pilate in John 19:11, â€œYou would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from aboveâ€¦â€ This authority to put Jesus to death would be odd if it didnâ€™t entail the general power to execute criminals."<br/><br/>"Finally, when He is dying of crucifixion, Jesus accepts the repentance of the thief on the cross, who says to his reviling companion, â€œDo you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deedsâ€¦.â€ (Luke 23:40-41)"<br/><br/>"Had Jesus disagreed with this statement, responding to it with the promise of eternal salvation was a rather obtuse way to express the correction."<br/><br/>"Beyond all this evidence that Jesus affirms the consistent Biblical principle of capital punishment, there is yet one more vital concept to grasp. Christians believe that Christ died on the cross to pay for the sins of us all."<br/><br/>"Although His sinlessness merited eternal life, He endured the death we deserved to extend that gift to us. As Prof. Michael Pakaluk so perfectly expressed the point, â€œIf no crime deserves the death penalty, then it is hard to see why it was fitting that Christ be put to death for our sinsâ€¦.â€ If we didnâ€™t deserve the death penalty ourselves, then why would Christ need to suffer it on our behalf in order to satisfy the justice of God? Denying the death penalty directly assaults the justice of the Father, Who required His own Son to pay precisely that price in our stead."<br/><br/>"What about the rest of the New Testament?"<br/><br/>"Since both Jesusâ€™s teaching and His death affirm the capital punishment, it should come as no surprise that the rest of the New Testament reinforces this view."<br/><br/>"When confronting Governor Festus, Paul says in Acts 25:11, â€œIf I am a wrongdoer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of these things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. He both affirms capital statutes and accepts them as binding on him if he has broken one."<br/><br/>"Later, in the New Testamentâ€™s most famous passage on the nature of government, Paul explains, â€œBut if you do what is evil, be afraid; for [the government] does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.â€ (Romans 13:4)"<br/><br/>"Finally, the same Bible which begins in Genesis 9:6 with the establishment of capital punishment, then carries the theme consistently throughout the text, and ends by reiterating it in Revelation 13:10, â€œIf any one is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if any one kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.â€ <br/><br/>"Literally from beginning to end, the Bible teaches that capital punishment is authorized and required by God."]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jesse,<br/><br/>The first question is this: Is God just? Of course the answer is yes: Psalm 7:11 "God is a just god"<br/><br/>The second question is this: Did God command the death penalty (as opposed to merely suggesting it)? The answer is, again, yes: Exodus 21:12 "He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death" and many others, simply search for "surely be put to death" in the Old Testament.<br/><br/>Therefore, God is just for requiring the death penalty.<br/><br/>The next question is this: Did God ever do away with the death penalty? <i>This</i> is where the argument lies, however, as Dudleysharp pointed out: There are multiple Biblical reasons to "prove" the death penalty still exists. The reasons to disregard the death penalty are very flimsy. If there is much interest, I could put together some resources on that latter part.<br/><br/>Therefore, God still requires the death penalty now, and is just in doing so.<br/><br/>So we must ask, as you (Jesse) did: In the (multiple) cases where the death penalty <i>could have</i> been administered, why was it <i>not</i> administered?<br/><br/>The answer comes down to a more in-depth understanding of the death penalty. For example, when scripture says (as in Exodus 21:12) the death penalty should be administered if one man kills another, it <i>further</i> says that: "However, if he did not lie in wait... etc." and the person is given a "safe haven" to flee to. This is where the difference in punishment between pre-meditated murder and accidental homicide exists. Besides these "clarifications", if you will, that are given after a command, we also have other requirements such as Deuteronomy 17:6 requiring "two or three witnesses", which is, not incidentally, where we get the <i>American</i> court system of requiring multiple witnesses to condemn someone.<br/><br/>Even further, I must point out that there are things which <i>are sins</i> but are <i>not</i> deserving of death. For example, God commands us to not covet, but if we do should we be put to death? The reason, although seemingly obvious, <i>must</i> be answered with scripture. We cannot put someone to death unless God commands.<br/><br/>I hope you can understand that, before we can really dig into specific cases (Paul, Nineveh, etc.) we need to at least cover the fundamentals.<br/><br/><b>On the case of Paul:</b><br/>Paul obviously put people to death, the question is: 1) Did he do so <i>lawfully</i>, following the Bible, or 2) Did he do so <i>unlawfully</i>, not following the Bible. The reason is this: If he did so lawfully, Paul would not be guilty of a crime deserving of the death penalty. He still <i>sinned</i>, even egregiously, but was he deserving of the death penalty? If he <i>was</i> deserving of death, why was he spared?<br/><br/>For that matter, as you point out, if Nineveh deserved the death penalty why was it not administered?<br/><br/>Are you arguing that the death penalty was <i>never</i> used? God's grace extends through <i>all</i> time, we are not in "an age of grace" now and an "age of law" in the Old Testament: God gave grace in the O.T. first.<br/><br/>In short (class is approaching, I did not realize I would write so long!), the death penalty is only <i>absolutely</i> required in the case of premeditated murder. In all other cases it was the <i>maximum</i> punishment available, much like you can be fined a maximum of $XXX for littering, but often are not. A great example is the administration of the death penalty for rebellious children: There is not a single Biblical case that I am aware of that this maximum penalty was administered.<br/><br/>I have to go, sorry if I didn't answer your question enough. If not, please let me know what part I can answer better.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[First let me put this out on the table. I do support the death penalty. Which is very clear from scripture(both OT and NT). One thing I want to point out before I move on is Toby said, "there are sins not requiring death..." However, I'm almost for sure he meant to say, not deserving capital punishment. For we all deserve damnation. Now we could go on to argue about scriptures that talk about committing murder and hating someone is the same. But I don't want to waste the time. <br/>   Now here is the deeper issue. For what reason did God give His law? More specifically capital punishment, of which we are discussing. Now I'm not asking what the requirements where for someone to be put to death. But am asking, why would a just and all loving God give such a commandment? Does He not say in the New Testament that He desires that no one should go to Hell?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Three of the greater things God has bestowed upon the common man.

Today I have been pondering heavily whether to retire from my position at an esteemed company, mostly for economic reasons. I am paid a reasonable $10 per hour, but working part time of 4 hours per day leaves me (subtracting gasoline, extra time spent, etc.) earning an effectual $5 per hour. This is not very good.

The main issue is twofold: To be able to arrive on time I must cease my studying a full hour before work starts. After work is finished, it takes me an hour to get home and clean up (mildly dirty work) before I am ready to do anything, studying included. This makes my effectual hours worked to be 6. If I worked more than four hours at a time this would help, but class schedules prevent this.

Anyways, I have tentatively decided to quit, even though it is a good job. I will hand in my resignation Monday unless I hear a good reason to stay.

Albert Einstein once said, "If one studies too zealously, one easily loses his pants." This being the case with myself, minus the pants problem, I have decided to do something about it: Not change it. This due to time constraints. Ackh!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Thoughts This Birthday</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I have been listening to a certain album, some music by a band called Hillsong. I really don't know much about the band, and I really don't need to for this story to make sense. Anyway, here begins a birthday story, leading into my birthday message:

When I was younger, when I had my first car, I had a cassette tape that I never really told anyone about at the time. I don't know where the cassette came from, it had to have been copied since it was a battered, generic looking tape. For nearly a year, whenever I drove in my car, I would listen to this tape.

Play side A.
Play side B.
Play side A.
Play side B.
On and on and on, it never stopped unless someone else was in the car, which is another story for another time.

I found the tape about a year ago, looking at how abused it was reminded me how much I had listened to it. I was not able to play it, my cassette player being mildly broken, and my wallet being mildly empty to buy a cassette player for one lonesome tape. So, with a tinge of regret, and trying to remember exactly what was on the tape that I would listen to it so much, I placed it securely back in it's box.

Fast forward (no pun in ten did) to last week: I was looking around on my now outdated mp3 player, seeing what albums I had which I have not listened to in a long time. I found a band called Hillsong, an untitled album, and songs with no track names. When I listened to this album, my heart stirred in me, remembering the songs on that old cassette that I had sung in my youth. This album, unknown by name to me and a little different than the old, I have listened to at least twice a day for the last three or so days.

Let me be clear on something: I am not usually fond of repetitious songs. I get cynical of churches that sing the "Off the wall, 7-11" songs, as I have called them, singing seven words eleven times. Neither am I usually very fond of highly emotional songs. Call me a cynic if you want, the Lord knows I am, but I have a basic distrust of "those" types of songs.

Let me be clear on one more thing: This album has several repetitious songs, this album is filled with emotional songs, and I like this album.

One song in particular I would like to draw your attention to, a song somewhere toward the end, where the words are "Holy, Holy, Holy God." and that is all. But you must hear this in your mind, for this is a live concert, and there are thousands of people there, all of them singing loudly praising the Lord.

And the instruments stop playing.

And the singer stops singing.

And the people keep singing:

"Holy, Holy, Holy God! Holy, Holy, Holy God! Holy, Holy, Holy God!"

How beautiful are the voices of these people, praising God with their voices! How passionately they cry out, "Holy God!"

And every time I hear it I am reminded of the verses in Revelations 5:
<blockquote>Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering <span style="font-style: italic;">thousands</span> upon <span style="font-style: italic;">thousands</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">ten thousand times ten thousand</span>. ... In a loud voice they sang: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!" Then I heard <span style="font-style: italic;">every</span> creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that is in them, singing: "To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!"</blockquote>
Think of it! We will be singing praise to the Lord God, thousands upon thousands upon thousands of Christians together, with Him there before us, we will <span style="font-style: italic;">sing</span> "To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!"

Friends, this is what I want to tell you on my 25th birthday:

I have never been more sure in my life of the sovereignty of God, of His complete authority, of His everlasting justice, of His grace to the lost, and of the beauty of His Holiness.

I have had trials, I have had terrible failures of sin, I have forsaken God in my weakness, and I have called out against Him. And still my Savior reaches out and grabs my unwilling hand, still my Lord and God forgives before I even call to Him, and even now my Father loves me with the love beyond all loves.

I know a few of you are struggling with sin, who have even given up the fight as I myself once did. I tell you this: I have never before been so sure of the power of Christ to break the bonds of sin if we call out to Him who alone has that power.

I have friends who have lost their worldly possessions. Friends who are living with abusive parents. Friends who are even now watching family members die before their eyes. And I have friends who have lost faith in Gods good graces. But please listen to me now.

This is my only message, on this my 25th birthday:

Do not turn to <span style="font-style: italic;">any other than God</span> to satisfy your heart, to free you from the bonds of sin, to bring you joy, and to give you true peace. Forsaking <span style="font-style: italic;">all else</span>, cling and cling to Christ. Don't be satisfied with what you have now, but take hold of the promise written in Psalms 107:
<blockquote>Oh that men would give thanks to the Lord for His <span style="font-style: italic;">goodness</span>, and for His wonderful works to the children of men! For He <span style="font-style: italic;">satisfies</span> the longing soul, and He <span style="font-style: italic;">fills</span> the hungry soul with <span style="font-style: italic;">goodness</span>.

Those who sat in <span style="font-style: italic;">darkness</span> and in the <span style="font-style: italic;">shadow of death</span>, bound in <span style="font-style: italic;">affliction</span> and irons -- because they rebelled against the words of God, and despised the counsel of the Most High, therefore He <span style="font-style: italic;">brought down</span> their heart with labor; they fell down, and there was none to help.

Then they <span style="font-style: italic;">cried out</span> to the Lord in their trouble, and He <span style="font-style: italic;">saved</span> them out of their distresses. He brought them <span style="font-style: italic;">out of darkness</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">shadow of death,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">broke</span> their chains in pieces. Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men! For He has broken the gates of bronze, and cut the bars of iron in two.</blockquote>
These are promises you can hold right now. This is real hope.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Struggling With Pride</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2008/12/23/struggling-with-pride/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past I have struggled with various sins. I used to have a very hot temper, and, although I have learned a lot of patience since then, even now certain things can really get me mad. I used to be very prideful, although now I am more humble than Moses himself. Actually, the obvious satire of the preceding statement is a triple twist: I take pride in the fact that I can make jokes about my lack of humility. Seriously.

Let me explain something: I am proud. Of all sins that I commit, this one seems to really stand at the root. In my struggles with anger, it was largely a sense of pride that made me rage. I wanted people to recognize what I had done, and to thank me for my works. In my struggles with self-discipline, I have pride which says that I don't need accountability. In my struggles with sexual thoughts and temptations, it was my pride which said that I could fight it by myself, that I didn't need God's help.

It is also my pride which keeps me from praying out loud to the God who should (and usually does) hold my affections. I confess to you (the internets?) that I find it difficult to pray out loud. Not because I don't think God can hear me, and not because of any other reason than this: I don't want to seem silly. Isn't that a strange thing? I don't mind acting the fool in certain ways in front of my friends, but I don't want to seem silly when I pray privately in my car. How foolish I am! How strangely and ridiculously proud I am!

In the past I have struggled to a very large degree with sexual thoughts, but a while back I sought the Lord for strength and surrendered these things to Him. I realized then that it was pride that made me not want to ask for help. It was my intense and absurd pride that held me back from asking God to help me. "I can do it myself", I would think, and then wonder why I couldn't gain ground. "The Lord will help me, if I need it, but I don't need to ask", I would reason. But over and over the Bible reinforces the need for requesting help from God.

In the past week I have had a similarly large struggle with sexual sins and realized today that I was trying again to fight them on my own. And then I realized my pride again when I began to confess myself to God and had much difficulty in praying out loud.

You see? It is this pride which holds us back, and it is this pride that was at the root of all sins: "I think I know what is best, in this situation", Adam thought. "I can reason this on my own, and I don't need to ask God about it", he said, eating the delicious looking fruit.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Battle with Sugar has Begun</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2009/02/04/my-battle-with-sugar-has-begun/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[All right. Time to pony up: I am a sugar addict.

I was drinking, easily, a 32 ounce shot of soda <span style="font-style: italic;">every</span> day for probably a month straight. Occasionally, I would drink <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> a day, making 64 ounces of pure soda. Dr Pepper. Mmmm, delicious! Thats 104 grams per day, or approximately half a cup of super processed "corn syrup" per week.

In addition, I was eating candy and cookies here and there, and eating out pretty often. I think you could view me as your normal sugar/soda addict.

Recently I had started exercising again, I can run two miles without any real problems, but I started having nausea and stomach pain. I asked a friend at my church who understands human health pretty well, and she said something like "If you don't change your ways, you will end up in the hospital soon!" So I gave up soda. Actually, I am giving up "corn syrup" and soda. But corn syrup is in <span style="font-style: italic;">everything!</span> And I mean <span style="font-style: italic;">EVERYTHING!</span>

So then today I was perusing around on the interblagosphere and found a great site, <a href="http://myyearwithout.blogspot.com/">myyearwithout.blogspot.com</a> where a lady is going a whole year without <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> processed sugar at all! Wow! And here I thought giving up soda would be a stretch! Then I watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-I_uhnwRa0">video</a> linked on her site (which explains the interaction of sugar levels in the body very easily) and got to thinking about my own blood sugar levels, and that I had probably just about killed my pancreas with sugar overload. Poor thing, I'ma so sorry.

So now it is Wednesday night and I have not had soda for four days, almost five, and I only feel one effect: I can't seen to drink enough water! I am <span style="font-style: italic;">so</span> thirsty! Whenever I wonder about something, I end up looking it up online. So I looked up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=i+cant+seem+to+drink+enough+water&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a">"i cant seem to drink enough water"</a> on Google, and got a bunch of people saying things like "You have diabetes."

Triple play.

In the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-I_uhnwRa0">video</a> linked above, the lady said something I thought was important: You don't need to eat sugar. Ever. Your body would do alright without it. Or something close to that, watch the movie and correct me. But the point being, I can do without sugar, although it is a very difficult challenge.

But I am up for the challenge, and I will be evaluating to what length I want to proceed tomorrow. Read the <a href="http://myyearwithout.blogspot.com/">blog</a> mentioned, it is positively <span style="font-style: italic;">marvelous</span>!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Facebook&#039;s Privacy Policy</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2009/02/24/on-facebooks-privacy-policy/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people have asked me to explain why I was so concerned with Facebooks policy change, as well as what the policy change actually was. So I will explain it to you, and I will try not to get on my soap box of privacy concerns too much.

There are really three issues which are important in this case, and one final summary concerning privacy in general.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">1:</span> On Monday, February 16th I believe, Facebook made a very large change to it's Privacy Policy. This change in the Policy was not made known to the user, and in fact was only revealed to me because of a privacy watchdog group.

While this may not seem like such a big deal, there are two implications which can and should be drawn from it: <span style="font-weight: bold;">A)</span> The policy you agreed to did state that Facebook was allowed to change it's policy without telling you explicitly about it, although they must make that information available at some location. This means that Facebook was within their *legal* right to change the policy as they did without alerting you explicitly.

However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">B)</span> almost all online services (eBay, Yahoo!, GMail, etc.) alert you when a change in the privacy policy has occured. Typically this is a letter to the effect of "We changed our policy, if you care look it up online." However, Facebook did not follow this standard courtesy. In point of fact, when Facebook last changed it's policy (November 26, 2008) it alerted it's users with an on-site pop-up that required you to personally dismiss it to make it go away, much like a persistent notification. This deliberate act of *not* telling it's users of the policy change brings up the question, why didn't they?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">2:</span> The new policy enacted by Facebook is more open-ended than any online service I have ever known, and I have read *every* Privacy Policy and Terms of Service agreement before I sign up. As of now, the official policy is as would seem natural to the average user: If you put up a picture, it is your picture. If you post a creative writing or letter or poem, that writing belongs to you. Facebook does not own it. However, the new policy stated that anything *ever* that you put on Facebook (pictures, notes, video, etc.) *belong* to Facebook.

Part of the exact wording is as follows: <span style="font-style: italic;">"The following sections will survive any termination of your use of the Facebook Service: ... User Content"</span> That is, even if you delete that picture, Facebook retains a copy and may keep it forever. How about a more explicit statement that was in the new policy: You grant Facebook <span style="font-style: italic;">"an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose"</span> I don't think that needs any more explanation.

It should be noted that Facebook CEO Zuckerberg responded, noting that it could understand the users concerns, but essentially saying <span style="font-style: italic;">"Trust us! We wouldn't do anything *bad* with your private data!"</span> No, seriously, that's pretty much *exactly* what they said. But how much trust should be placed in a company that doesn't tell it's users when a major policy change occurs?

<span style="font-weight: bold;">3:</span> Because of the fact that <span style="font-weight: bold;">a)</span> Facebook has a history of alering it's users to policy changes, but did not alert the user in this case, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">b)</span> Facebook has grown to be a Billion dollar company and so has very fine lawyers and public relations people, which brings up <span style="font-weight: bold;">c)</span> The change in the Privacy Policy was not a misunderstanding, rather, <span style="font-weight: bold;">d)</span> The Privacy Policy change was a carefully deliberated attempt to secure complete control over the users data.

This is not the first time Facebook has attempted such an endeavour, neither will it be the last. As you can see, I still use Facebook, although I will be increasingly careful of what information I put on here.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">4:</span> What does it all mean? It means this: The Internet Is Serious Business.

Do not be fooled by Facebook's shiny delivery. If you do not want a picture of yours to belong to someone else, don't put it online and especially don't put it on Facebook. If you don't want telemarketers and junk mailers knowing your address and phone number, keep them off of Facebook. If you write creatively, and want to retain rights over those writings, don't put them on Facebook.

Thanks for reading, please feel free to ask questions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Constantine (2005)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know the movie has been out a while, but Saturday night I watched <span style="font-style: italic;">Constantine</span>, starring Keanu "I Know Kung-Fu" Reaves, and some other woman who is not really important. It had the person who played Jadis, the Narnian witch who was oppressing those <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of color</span> other animals. Of course, starring Keanu Reaves is alright, it just means we can already predict the general feel of the movie. (Hint: Reaves is a typecast actor.) The movie is based on a DC Comics version, but I never read it so I can't say much about that.

In general, I think the movie was pretty well done, the story was reasonably captivating and the special effects blended pretty well into the background. The general story plot is that John Constantine (Reaves) is trying to buy his way into heaven by doing the "dirty work" of sending meddling demons back into hell. I'm not that knowledgeable of Catholic tradition, so I don't know how accurately it follows that, although I'm sure as a movie it takes some liberties.

Throughout the movie, John is shown as a man trying to earn his way into heaven. He speaks with Gabriel, pointing out the list of rules humans must follow, getting angry that he can never do enough to get God's favor. John says that he believes in God, to which Gabriel replies that belief is not enough to get into heaven. Of course, this is exactly what scripture says, that we aren't saved by keeping the law, and that it is not works that saves us. The Bible says that believing that God exists is not enough, the devil does that as well. Towards the end of the film, Gabriel even points out that all John had to do was accept the work of Christ and he would be redeemed. "You have it so easy," Gabriel says, speaking of the inability of angels to repent.

While I admired the depths to which the film hit home the point of salvation not being works based, in the end John is being let into heaven. For what? For giving up his life to save another, which is a work. In the end the film fails, in that it clearly says God will allow you into heaven if you sacrifice your own life. This would be a works based salvation, but it goes against what scripture says.

Another thing which bothered me was when John said that "They have the Bible in hell, except it puts a whole different spin on Revelations." His point was, to some degree, that we don't have the entire Word of God with us, that the Bible is not all there. However, we know this to be false, in that the Bible says "Not one jot or tittle shall pass away", and it further says God will preserve His word. Throughout the book of Psalms, there are promises concerning what I will call the preservation of scripture. The movie <span style="font-style: italic;">Constantine</span> fails in that regard, that it portrays the Bible as a faulty manuscript, that somewhere out there is the correct version.

Another thing I took issue with, was the treatment of angels and demons, that God and the devil are playing some sort of high stakes game, with people as the pawns. In fact, a premise of the entire movie was that God was not <span style="font-style: italic;">actively</span> participating in the world, that God only acts through angels. However, the Bible clearly shows the path of history to be one which glorifies God through all things. By the end I was especially thankful that <span style="font-style: italic;">Constantine</span> had it wrong, that God <span style="font-style: italic;">does still</span> take an active role in shaping history.

One thing which <span style="font-style: italic;">Constantine</span> does, if nothing else, is point out the one fact I too often forget: As it says in Ephesians, our fight is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and spiritual things. We as Christians, myself particularly I know, need to be constantly on the guard for spiritual attacks. They are not filled with special effects, neither are they usually nearly so dramatic, but the Bible says they are real. John Constantine says that if you can't see demons, they can't see you, but the Bible makes it clear that the fight rages on against us regardless of our action: There is no neutrality in the matter, a point which John brought up to his Snoop-Dawg friend.

Thankfully, we know from the Bible that God is on our side, that He takes an active hand in the universe, and that He has given <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> Christians the Holy Spirit as a helper. Praise God that <span style="font-style: italic;">Constantine</span> is wrong on those issues!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started my new temporary job today: revamping a mission groups web-site, you can view the new site <a href="http://biblicalblueprints.org/">here</a>. I really appreciate their ministry, and they offered me the work Friday last week.

I have some ideas about the back-end, how to make the "Resources" more searchable and workable, change the layout to be more intuitive, and a little changes in color scheme (mostly I hope to define the gray/blue/brown spectrums more definitively). This work should only take me a couple weeks, and by then I will be working with my brother on his new acquisition: A house in Ashland!

Also, The Religious Politic is going well-ish, I have a very large pile of writings that I drafted, my hope is to be able to write an article once per week on a consistant basis. I have considered posting a writing each week about the previous Sunday sermon, I just think it might not fit into the Religious Politic scheme, so it might go here or I might devote a new blog to it.

The house is still a mess, mostly my stuff-to-get-rid-of is piled up in the livinig room. I had originally wanted to host a garage sale, but I haven't really had time on the weekends, so I might pile most of it into the car and drive it to some charity thrift store.

Hopefully soon I will have a camera, that is my next planned purchase after I get money and pay off bills. With a camera I will be able to take pictures of my car project. The lack of camera is actually what has been holding me back on working on the car. That and money, actually.

I got my piano moved into the new house finally, and have not really practiced on it much since then. I also borrowed my Father's trumpet today, I might be able to actually play it within a few weeks: The lip stress is a bit more than I imagined earlier.

Okay, that's about it! Take care, write if you get work, hang by your toes!]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been reading through the book "Holiness by Grace", by Bryan Chapell, and I came across this section which I thought was worth repeating.

Pg. 135, par. 4 and following:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Consider the pressures that face modern Christians despite centuries of refining biblical thought and fighting for biblical principles. The fortresses of fundamentalism that artificially kept potential temptations at arm's bay by demonizing all forms of alcohol, tobacco, card playing, and theatre going are crumbling throughout the evangelical world. At the same time, the accessibility and allurement of the Internet have put sexual temptation, material indulgence, gambling entertainment, personal disengagement, and ungodly communications within a mouse-click of persons of every age and social station. The expectations of business travel, the interactivity of genders in the workplace, the "freedoms" of the pill, the isolation provided by closed-apartment lifestyles (even when living in million dollar homes), the personal anonymity allowed by multi-thousand seat worship centers, the enticements of consumerism endlessly promoted by amoral Western prosperity--all combine to create a culture where sin is nearer to the door of even the most socially respectable than ever before.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the same time that these winds of external change blast us, changing patterns of family and church relationships make our spiritual footing unsure. A short list of the cultural gales that have swept over our traditional centers of spiritual development would include: divorce frequency, domestic partnership acceptability, single-parent families, two-parent paychecks, abortion availability, day care, the busyness of soccer-moms and career- or hobby dads, the media preoccupation of teens, the recreation orientation of Sunday, and the decline of biblical literacy. The breakdown of traditional structures that nurture faith not only have robbed us of models of how to live godly lives, but have also removed even from Christians the ordinary restraints against temptation that past generations of believers had built (sometimes through inappropriate legalism) into their lives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Combating this cultural mix of libertine tendencies with the gospel of God's unconditional love is counter intuitive. Strong assurance of God's unearned affection would seem almost assured to lead to abuse (and excuse) of grace in order to pursue freedoms contrary to Scripture. When religious opponents argued with John Bunyan in prison, they urged him not to assure his Christian friends of God's unswerving love. "If you keep assuring the people of God's love," the opponents argued, "they will do whatever they want." Replied Bunyan, "If I assure God's people of his love, then they will do whatever he wants."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Of course, there are those who will try to take advantage of God's mercy to excuse their wrongdoing. However, those who truly love God and have their renewed hearts continually warmed by reminders of his mercy, desire to please him. Due to the limitations of our humanity this desire does ebb, but is refueled both by the scriptural promises of God's care and by the observation of what occurs to those who depart from his ways.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The consequence of wandering from God's path are evident in the moral "freedoms" of our fracturing society. With all this personal liberty, we have discovered great bondage--not merely to occasional temptation, but to ingrained patterns of biblical violation, unhealthy thought, and spiritually destructive behavior. Our slavery becomes apparent in our prayers for release from compulsive, addictive, and repeated sin. We pray, "God, please help me to stop ... to stand against this temptation ... to resist this sin ... to change this habit ... to act differently ... to be rid of this compulsion ... not to fall again, to yield again, or to be this way again ..."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our release from the perception that we must live according to the law of merit does not end our longing for freedom from personal indulgence and selfishness. We want our identity in Christ to become the foundation of a life that is not shackled to the world's empty promises of happiness, pleasure, and fulfillment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

To keep an eye on what's going on at DCC, and to keep myself a bit more accountable, I decided what I will do is listen to the sermon online and make some comments and thoughts about it. So here is the first installation, which is from the last sermon I attended at DCC:

Sunday's sermon was based on Matthew 5:21-26, where Jesus reminds us that anger is a very serious sin, even to the point of saying that someone who is angry at his "brother" and says "You fool!" is in danger of <span style="font-style: italic;">hell fire</span>!

In my own life I must confess that I have been very angry in my youth. I could probably think of a thousand reasons for why I was angry, from being bullied by my church peers to my family aggravating me, and so on. However, were these righteous causes for anger? Some may have been, I suppose, but I think that most of those times my anger has been an unrighteous one.

I realized this problem of anger stemmed from a serious lack of patience, and so one summer I prayed that God would teach me patience. In all honesty, this can seem like a dangerous move, since it seems God may teach you patience through tribulations. Of course, He will do it in what way you will best learn. Now I have learned patience, and have lost my former anger.

Sinful anger is manifested in three general ways, each sinful:
<ol>
	<li>When it says in verse 22 that "whoever is angry with his brother" it is an emotion of anger which is shown as sin. We can't just say "I would never yell at someone" and excuse our anger, since even the thought of anger is sinful.</li>
	<li>When it says "whoever says to his brother" it is the word of anger which is shown as a sin. When we speak in anger to someone, it is a sin. We might want to call it ten thousand different things, a popular one being "venting", but speaking to someone in anger is also a sin.</li>
	<li>Finally, we have angry actions as well.</li>
</ol>
We should be careful to catch the sin of anger when it starts, when it is in the heart. If we don't catch it there, it will manifest as words, and then as actions. Later, you might find yourself beating your spouse, but remember it starts in the heart. "Whoever is angry at his brother without cause" means the sin of anger starts in the heart.

Of course, there are righteous causes for anger. That is: Not all anger is sinful, since it says "whoever is angry at his brother <span style="font-style: italic;">without cause</span>." What are the general principles found in righteous or Godly anger?
<ol>
	<li>The anger is "God-like", that is, it is angry at things God is angry at. Anger that abortion runs unchecked, and that many in the church support lawlessness? That is anger for the right reason.</li>
	<li>Godly anger is "legal", it is in accordance with God's law. When you become angry that someone stole your motorcycle, you can't go out seeking vigilante justice, breaking the thief's car tires.</li>
	<li>Godly anger is not explosive, but is only slowly provoked. When a parent suddenly blows up at their child, even if it is for a right reason, it is not Godly anger. God has great compassion, and is slow to anger. We should be as well.</li>
	<li>Godly anger does not take pleasure in wrath or judgement. A parent should take no pleasure in spanking their child; An employee should not find glee in the firing of an annoying co-worker.</li>
</ol>
One thing I took note of was the statement: "If it is worth getting angry over, it is worth resolving." Too many times I have got myself worked up over something, but not taken the time to properly resolve the issue.

That's my thoughts on the issue, thanks for reading!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I found a 1889 World-Herald</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have in my possession an "Omaha Daily World-Herald" newspaper from July 15, 1889 (yes you read that right), which is quite awesome to behold. The paper itself is yellowed and slightly brittle, the top edges showing the effect of time and oxidation, and the ink has nearly been worn off at the creases.

What is most interesting to note, at least to me, is the actual news articles. They are generally short, concise, and lacking the general left/right-wing political barbs. Try this one on for size (front page news, mind you:
<blockquote>McCook, Neb., July 14-[Special.]-The Catholic church and the dwelling of Banker Shaw, which were simultaneously struck and set on fire during the electric storm of Saturday morning, have been found badly damaged, and but for the prompt work of the fire department would have been completely burned. The former is damaged to the extent of $800, and the latter to $1,200, both covered by insurance.</blockquote>
The whole thing was well written and concise and it's pretty neat and to the point. Here's one of my favorites, it's about some lady who saw some dude beating his wife, so this lady tells him he should be ashamed. It ends with guns, so awesome:
<blockquote>Baltimore, Md., July 14-[Special]-Another murder is added to Baltimore's list. Elizabeth Ellen Gross shot and killed James E. Coates early this morning. The Gross woman states that Coates was beating his wife and she (Gross) told him he should be ashamed. Coates said he would kill her. Shortly after Coates whipped out a razor and used threatening language to the Gross woman, when she took her histol out of her pocket and shot him dead.</blockquote>
Now, I'm not a big fan of people getting shot, and I don't know what the outcome of the trial was (assuming there was one), but it sure seems to me like the guy had it coming. First of all, he was beating his wife. This in itself is not a crime punishable by death, but is certainly a bad thing, and a sure sign of uncontrolled physical aggression. Second, he threatened "the Gross woman", a statement which makes me chuckle, even though it is serious. Finally, he pulls out a razor and (I like to imagine) starts walking toward the woman.

Times have sure changed, haven't they? Used to be a woman could be counted on to carry a pistol for emergencies, but what do we have now? Guys in Congress passing laws making it harder for a woman to defend herself, that's what, those spineless bast...

Anyways, the real thing I wanted to show you was this next piece, note that this also was on the <span style="font-style: italic;">front page</span> of the Omaha World Herald. I'm only typing out part of it, so here's the backdrop: In Charleston, S.C., this dude McDow confesses to adultery and murder, but a jury ("a packed jury, as some claim") acquitted him. The World-Herald prints a piece of a sermon preached by one of a group of preachers who are denouncing McDow. Below you will find most of that sermon reprinted. May I remind you, this was on the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">front page</span></span>. I don't think that would happen anytime soon. Also keep in mind, this was 1889, so the word choice is a bit different, though perfectly readable to most of my home-school friends:
<blockquote>Bad neighborhood and covetousness, two ill-favored children of sin and grand children of lust; already born. Where, surely, will this base conditioned family end, and the devilish meaness of this spirit of coveteousness; who can fitly characterize it. It coveted what? The pearl of womanhood; all that goes to make woman woman, her chastity. With snake-like sinuousity and treachery it invades the neighbor's home, makes a breach upon the household in the absence of their lawful protectors and besieges a peculiarly defenseless woman to posess this pearl. A man's house you say is his castle. His maid servant by the law of the Tenth commandment is for all obligations of defense his.Now who, self-confessedly, was the first invader of the house, the castle, the home. And such an invasion for a purpose so base. What are the moral, and what should be the legal deserts of such an invader. If the well being of society is ever to be established, vindicated, with what holy anger, what burning moral indignation should such a spirit and conduct be clearly and strongly reprobated.

Lust when crossed, exposed, reproved or hopelessly baffled, is prone to kill. Call it in the courts by whatever name you will, in accordance with the evidence adduced, whether self defense, manslaughter or murder--lust leads to the fatal conclusion--death. Bloodshed, killing, is the outcome; a result dependent upon the firstwooings of lust, which never would or could have occured if the sinful course of lust had not been entered upon. Hence, morally, sensual lust, or rather the one guilty of indulging in it is at first hand responsible.

In the natural and moral order the Apostle James, in the utterance of the text, is right where he says, "When lust hath concieved, it bringeth forth sin; and sin when it is full grown, bringeth forth death," and however on one occasion one may be legally, from doubt or lack of evidence, acquitted, whose sensual, lustful course has led to the slaying of another, yet must it ever be logically truethat sensual lust, when allowed freely to run its full course, may end in the gallows as it's goal.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How things are going</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A little update: I have started classes again, this morning I started with a class on ordinary differential equations. It is a real blast so far, I am pretty excited to learn this. Also, a friend's husband is in the same class, so that should be fun.

I have been thinking about yesterday's (Sunday) sermon, where Rodney talked about Ecclesiastes. The first verse says that the book is the "words of the Preacher", which is the normal translation. But Rodney was saying how the word (qoheleth) also means something like "collector of information", which would roughly translate to a modern "scientist". Then he talked about how one could view the whole book as a sort of "white paper", that is, as a scientific analysis of (from 2:3) "what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all their days".

I started rereading the book of Ecclesiastes in this light—as a sort of research paper—and it makes a lot more sense to me, of course with a little help noticing some terms from Rodney. So basically, Solomon spent many years of his life doing research, trying to figure out what it was that people were supposed to be doing with their lives. He spends some time on gaining possessions, some on building beautiful architecture, some on developing art, and at all of these things he says he excelled greater than anyone.

But in the end, Solomon grows bitter and despondent over his failed experiment. But notice the two terms "under heaven" and "under the sun". The former is used twice at the beginning of the book, when he tells what his goal is "what was good for the sons of men to do <span style="font-style: italic;">under heaven</span> all their days", but all the mentions of "under the sun" have negative connotations. In a word, Solomon was trying this experiment without living his life "under heaven", that is, under God's direction.

Like many scientists of our day, Solomon thought that truth could be gained while completely divorced from anything spiritual. This is simply not the case, and Solomon's failed experiment serves as a lesson to us. Much like all scientific experiments, even if they fail they serve as something that you don't need to do: Someone already tried that, don't bother it won't work.

Solomon tried living life apart from God, and he failed. He grew bitter at his wisdom and wealth, despondent over the fact that it would be inherited by some fool later, bothered that everybody just seems to die in the end.

But in the end, I think Solomon reconciled to God, since at the end he says:
<blockquote>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man's all. For God will bring every work into judgement, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Found: 105 year old letter, very sad.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was trying to clean up my room (nice try) when I found an old Bible that I had picked up at an auction a few years ago. I had decided to throw it away, since the binding is falling apart and it's in such bad shape, but then I decided to see how old it actually was.

The earliest marked date inside is 1894, making the Bible itself at least 115 years old. I couldn't find a printing date on it, so I had to rely on the writings inside to date it.

While flipping through the pages, I found a letter dated February 1, 1904, which I am reproducing as best I can here. It is a sad letter about death: Family members, wishing for it, and more.

The writing is in a difficult cursive, so there are several words I can't make out, my apologies. Additionally, the punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks have been preserved.
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Feb 1, 1904
my Dear friend my
heart has been going
out for you ever since
I heard of your little
girl would of liked to saw
her we have had two
such little girls in my
family my oldest brothers
girl and a sisters girl
are lived to be fourteen
and a constant suffer
at the time until death
released her the other are
is living and is 46 years
old she was helped so she
does not suffer but is
cripple and I have heard
her say she did not see
why they did not let her
die when she was little as
long as they knew she had
to be a cripple we carried
her on pillow for year and
half and when she would
<span style="font-size: 85%;">???</span> we would <span style="font-size: 85%;">???</span> to
now sister what is your
loss is her gain she is
a bright star for your
<span style="font-size: 85%;">???</span> try and be <span style="font-size: 85%;">???</span>
and live to meat hes in
that better world.
I will come and see you
as soon as I can and if
you came to Perkins ever
come and see me
I thank you for the little
dress and I shall always
keep it yours very Lovingly Mrs E P Coats</blockquote>
I can't make out a few of the words, sorry, the cursive was very difficult to read!

When it says "if you ever come to Perkins", I wondered if there was a Perkins, Nebraska? <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=perkins,+ne&amp;sll=40.813628,-96.70262&amp;sspn=0.286863,0.617294&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.794383,-101.431961&amp;spn=0.017934,0.038581&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A">Surprise!</a> I doubt it meant Perkins the Restaraunt.

One strange thing: When I was helping my brother on a house in Ashland, I found a short hand written note with the same exact style of handwriting! The letter formation was systematically the same: I would give the letter formation and stroke pattern an 85-92% similarity. Additionally, the paper was the same type and fiber, although it could have been a common peper back in 1904. When I can, I will see if I can find the Ashland document and do a more thorough comparison.

The letter is rather sad, and on the last page there appears to be a tear spot. From the ink movement I think it was from the person who received the letter.

The letter was not addressed to anyone except "my Dear friend", but inside the Bible were the following names:
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Charlotte Christine Spurgeon
Family Bible, died Sep 1923
WilliamMadison Spurgeon
died 1906-
Allen Faradome? Spurgeon
died Nov 18 - 1945-
Ca?etti? Stockton Spurgeon
died Nov 10 - 1947-
Given to Dorothy Ann Johnson
Christmas time Dec 1969
By Myrtle Bentlty [76 yrs old]
after having this Bible in
her preession a number of
years.</blockquote>
That is all.

		<title>A Summary of Google Wave</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Wave is a product developed by Lars Rasmussen and Stephanie Hannin, the original developers of the Google Maps program. The product, Google Wave, is a communication and collaboration tool which is similar to e-mail but "upgradeable" with robot extension API's.

A great portion of the internet is communication of information, in the form of e-mail, instant messages, blogs, wikis, and so on. The method of collaboration for each of those is still rather primitive. Consider, for example, the act of replying to an e-mail: You need to copy the message to a new message, make your own comments, and then send. Now there are two copies of the original message floating around.

For those familiar with Google email, <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, you will recognize the idea of a "conversation", where a replied message is attached to the original message in a way. This way, the Gmail reader has the entire conversation easily clickable instead of having to track down through dozens of different emails to find the original questions.

This use of "conversations" in Gmail still relies on the same copy and paste, which results in multiple copies of the email floating around. The only change is really in the graphical interface. The new idea of the Wave completely changes that by getting rid of the copies.

As I type up a new message it is stored on the remote server. When I select you as the recipient, the server does not send you the message, instead the actual message is retained in the server. When you make a reply to me, you actually modify the original wave, either by appending data (the standard reply method), by inserting reply text in the original, or even by altering the original text. The original message is now on the server with the modification made to it.

(If you are familiar with code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">revision control</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> and the like, you might get a better understanding if I called it code revision control for e-mail)

The modification made to the message is stored, and to maintain accountability <span style="font-style: italic;">who</span> modified it is stored. In the interface, there is a sort of "playback" button, so you can go back in the documents history and see who made what modification. This method of revision control is absolutely amazing for any kind of collaborative document work.

Let me give some examples, which were given in the video, as to how this method of revision works:

On a simple level, an online chess game is sent through a Wave. I send it to you with my first move already made. You make your move (modifying the document through javascript probably) and send it back to me. We do this back and forth a few times. To review how the chess game has unfolded, use the "playback" feature, drag the playback bar to wherever in the game you have doubts and you can see what moves were made. The important thing to note is that there is only <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> copy of the message, starting from the original to the present version. You could think of each message as a wiki page, if you are familiar with how they are edited, although they are shared privately between whoever is on the Wave's contact list.

This simple example also demonstrates the potential to utilize java within a wave, the java making alterations to the message. A how-to document could be sent in a wave to some developers, each developer can modify the original how-to document, and there is only one final copy. If you reach a point where you could perhaps call it in alpha stage, you can start a new Wave with the alpha stage document, so no past history is available on the new wave, only the old wave.

E-mail and instant messaging are protocols from back in the 60's, based purely on analog communication methods. The new Wave protocol allows instantaneous communication, based entirely on real-time networked communication methods. The document changes are so much in real-time, that as I type on my computer, the other reader can see what I am typing. Of course, there are times when this is undesirable, and this feature can be turned off. However, considering the collaborative document, there is no reason five or more people cannot work on the same document at the <span style="font-style: italic;">same time</span>.

Again, the concept of a Wave is, roughly, a personal communication and collaboration tool. A Wave is a bit of communication, anything that can be transmitted through standard HTML, that is published in real time. The possibilities are nearly endless, if you look on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&amp;search_query=google+wave&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a> you might be able to find some examples already.

A second thing Google debuted at the show was Spelly, their spell checker, which checks the way things are spelled based on a large algorithm which takes <span style="font-style: italic;">context</span> into account, along with a lot of other statistical analysis models. What this means is you won't get something like "Let' meat tomorrow" getting past the spell checker. This alone is something very impressive.

I hope I have piqued your interest enough to check it out, you can read about it on the following links, but a video demonstration is helpful to explain things which words cannot. "A picture is worth a thousand words" type of idea.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You and I had
good times. (That's us,  you and I)
There was depth to
our conversations, (no one can deny this)
and
none of  our faults (it's nothing personal)
would  separate us.
It seems like we hardly knew each other.
Every thing  you did,
every word you said,
it is burned in my mind.
Seared  by commitment
and our promise.
But you never promised me all of  yourself.
We both knew who
held our hearts strings.
And I  believe that covenant,
those truths we held on to.
But it is hard  to believe
when I can't see.
This moment of sorrow, when it is  hard to believe,
Right now:
This is where faith and life collide.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is good, I think, to periodically review one's past life. Not to wallow in self-pity or regret, and not to be filled with pride over how many challenges one has accomplished, but to take take note of one's "inner man", to seek to understand.

So here it is, nearing midnight, and I am reflecting on another year gone by. Another year of failures and regrets, of life half spent and inner conflicts never resolved. Another year of should haves, of would haves, of broken promises and empty dreams.

And yet there is within me a hope and a peace that burns fiercer than any earthly fire.

There is an anticipation for more, a quickening of my heart, when I look forward.

I have purpose, and it is being directed by someone who is far wiser than myself.

		<title>On spiritual blindness</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2010/01/26/on-spiritual-blindness/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a review of last Sunday's sermon and a personal study of the thing.

On Sunday my pastor talked about the idea of spiritual blindness, reading about the concept in Acts 28:17-27, where Paul tells of how he got to Rome. Though Paul had done nothing against the Jewish customs, the leaders had accused him. When he was examined by the civil authorities, they found nothing against him, yet the Jews wanted to put him to death.

The Jewish leaders were presented with the evidence, yet refused to be convinced.

In verses 26-27, the prophet Isaiah says that the people will hear and see, but they will not understand or perceive because "their eyes they have closed". The people had blinded themselves to the truth, but they could not see it.

The idea of spiritual blindness is found in many places in scripture, I will list a few here (italics added for emphasis):
<blockquote>This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, having their understanding darkened, being alienated from God, because of the ignorance that is in them, <em>because of the blindness of their heart</em> (Ephesians 4:17-18)</blockquote>
<blockquote>For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel... (Romans 11:25)</blockquote>
Why does this spiritual blindness exist? In part, it is because the human mind is against God, as it says:
<blockquote>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be. (Romans 8:7)</blockquote>
This should concern us, that we could be blinded to the sin in our lives, or that we could be blinded to the truth of God's Words. However, we know that it is God who can fix this state of blindness:
<blockquote>For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of Jesus Christ. (2 Corinthians 4:6)</blockquote>
We should not be surprised when people read the Bible and do not understand; much like the Jews who had heard Paul's sincere argument, which was according to their own prophets and scripture, but yet remained "spiritually blind" and wanted to kill him.

Yet even so we have been given a great promise, that if we turn to the Lord for wisdom, He will give it to us:
<blockquote>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. (James 1:5)</blockquote>
And, speaking of a mind blinded to the truth, the Bible says:
<blockquote>Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. (2 Corinthians 3:16)</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning's reading included Proverbs chapter 6, which has a few verses which I have been thinking about. The writer talks about the "seductress" in verses 24-35, where he says that the law is a light which keeps you from her. The two verse sections of interest to me were in 27-28, which says
<blockquote>Can a man take fire to his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be seared? (Proverbs 6:27-28)</blockquote>
These seem obvious enough to me. Hint: The answer to both of them is no.

Now, some may argue that you <em>can</em> walk on hot coals and not be burned, and they will point to fire walkers and the like. But fire walking existed nearly as far back as history records, so I doubt that such things were unknown to the author. In fact, a quick search shows that the Lord promises to protect us, even so we could walk through fire unharmed.
<blockquote><span id="isa43-2">When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, Nor shall the flame scorch you. (Isaiah 43:2)</span></blockquote>
My first instinct is to say that, walking through fire without being harmed is likely only something that can be done with "supernatural" powers, aka, spiritual forces.

But what verse I was really interested in was verse 30-31, which seems a little out of place, and has been used (usually ignoring verse 31) to argue the idea of communism:
<blockquote>People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving. Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold; he may have to give up all the substance of his house. (Proverbs 6:30-31)</blockquote>
When I read this passage this morning, it seemed a little out of place. The author talks about the adulteress woman and the harlot, and then interrupts to say something about a thief. What's up with that?

After some initial thinking, I wondered if the author was saying that people may understand if you have a moment of weakness and commit adultery with another woman. I mean, maybe she's totally beautiful or something.

However, that didn't really seem to go with the rest of the verses, especially verse 33 which says it will be a reproach to him. So now that I have had a morning to think about it, I think the author is basically saying this:
<blockquote>If a guy is really poor, people won't be too upset about it if he steals to get some food. I mean, the guy is starving! But even though they forgive the guy, he still has to pay restitution, as much as the law says he has to pay, and not a penny less. And if it's the case that people still enforce the law on some poor dude who didn't seem to have any other choice, how much more for someone who is just carried away with passion? Dudes, seriously, you'd have to be an idiot to do that. (Tobias Davis Paraphrase)</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's nearly midnight here, and I should be getting in bed so I can enjoy the Sabbath tomorrow. Thankfully I slept in today, so I can stay up for another few hours and be fine. I mean, be <span style="font-style: italic;">mostly</span> fine.

Lately I have been accosted by many troubling situations, mostly by friends who, I found out, no longer consider themselves to be "Christian". These are people who have, at least to my general knowledge, been reasonably active "Christians", and people who I never would have suspected to desert "the faith".

You will notice I put a few choice words in quotation marks, and perhaps you wonder why I did that? I have been thinking, since this happened, about how several of my friends currently attend church, and if pressed would probably say they are "Christian", but in reality I would not be able to tell. What I mean is, I think a disturbingly large percentage of youth presently attending church have not made a conscious decision to believe the need for God's saving sacrifice.

Many times I have even become disappointed by the lack of commitment shown in the current "youth" of the church, and I wonder why it is that this could happen.

In a large part, I would place the blame on the previous generation, for not raising their children as they ought. I have spoken against public education before, and the more I study the Bible the more strongly I conclude that public education is a sin. Not just "a bad idea" but a sin, and like murder and theft it has far-reaching results. While this may be a conversation for another time, I would place the blame for the failure of this generation on the failure of the previous generation to actively take part in their child's education.

But I digress.

When I see all of these people, and don't know if they are saved or not, it makes me wonder: "Do they <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> that I am a Christian, or do they just assume?" Must I always say "I am a Christian" when I see people? Certainly I must not be ashamed to say it, but should I say it all the time, just to remind everyone?

These are the things which keep me awake late at night.

That and wondering if I could assemble a Victorian era suit for a reasonable price.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have been feeling similar to you regarding the youth of today (heck, we&#39;re getting old fast!). <br /><br />I agree with your estimation of the root cause of this problem: parents&#39; resignation of their responsibility to raise their own children and their subsequent abandoning of them to the institutional evil of government education. <br /><br />I believe parents may send their children to government &quot;educational&quot; facilities without intentionally sinning. At best,  this is unwise. <br /><br />However, I&#39;m hard-pressed to think of a detailed argument that would remove this action from the category of unintentional sin. <br /><br />(On an humorous note, the conservative talk show hosts Chuck and Larry Bates have said that if you send your kid to public school, you hate him).<br /><br />By the way, I&#39;m excited to say that I&#39;ve found a free Online version of the one-of-a-kind book &quot;The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.&quot; Check it out at http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So right about now I'm starting to worry about my finances. I have, I don't know, about 20$ on me. Maybe less. It's hard to get around with that little of money, I'm noticing.

But here's the thing: I have plenty of <span style="font-style: italic;">potential</span> money. I mean, I have a car that I'll be selling this weekend, Kelly Blue Book estimates it's value at 1200$. I have a pretty cool cell phone I can sell for about 25 bucks, once this part comes in. I have a laptop that I'm selling for a couple hundred. I could even sell my netbook for a little over a hundred, and with a little work I could sell my other car for about 1000$.

So it's not that I don't have capital, it's that I don't have <span style="font-style: italic;">Federal Reserve Notes</span>. The almighty dollar. And that's where it counts, don't it?

It's not that I'm doing badly, it's just that I don't have 10 million in untraceable dollars sitting around in my bedroom.

Because that's what I want: 10,000,000$

Ten million smackers. Ten million.

I guess if it was in gold bullion I wouldn't complain, but it's hard to buy things with gold. It's hard for me to go out and buy a 12-axis CNC machine with gold.

How on earth do mad scientists get their funding? I'm sure it's through some illegal means, but it's never talked about and I want to find out so I can follow in the steps of the mad.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Patenting Newton&#039;s Laws</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2010/01/14/patenting-newtons-laws/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During my first week of the current semester I had the privilege of spare time, and this time I spent doing some final research on some scientific stuff that I won't bore you with here. During the process I came across some boxes in the Engineering Library at UNL, these boxes were the size of a paper sheet and about 3" tall. On the front of each of the boxes was the label "Plant Patents".

"Plant Patents?", I wondered to myself, "Maybe manufacturing plants?"

But there were about 100 of these boxes, and that would be a strange way to save manufacturing blueprints, so I popped one open. Inside each box I found about 300 little 'pagelets'. Two pages stapled together, on one was a color picture of a flower or vine or some other plant, and on the other page was the patent text.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Chrysanthemum Gloria Speakum Latinum</span>, said one, and it's description was just as interesting: "Stamen is more red than the standard breed" and also "Leaves have a more waxy feel than <span style="font-style: italic;">Crysanthemum Gloria Nospeakum Latinum</span>".

I looked at about a dozen of these "patents" and they were all the same: Somebody got a patent on some plant that they bred with another plant. Not through generations of successive breeding even, just one breeding attempt. It's like the flower guys went patent happy "Hahahaha! Let's patent <span style="font-style: italic;">everything</span>!"

Also this week I had a class about mechanisms. Little gears, swing arms, and all that stuff. Things like the Archimedes screw and gear teeth are thousands of years old but still in wide use today, and I get to study them. In fact, there are at least a few mechanisms that are so widely known, and go so far back in history that they are almost considered physical <span style="font-style: italic;">laws</span>. They will never cease to exist until the earth ceases to exist.

But in looking at some mechanisms, I noticed that some of them were patented. And I'm not talking about the mechanism in the Ferrari engine, I'm talking about a bar swinging on a pivot. Something kids make with their Tinker Toys. Patented.

Maybe you aren't as amazed at this as I am, so let me try an analogy:

When you have two objects sitting on your table, they are both attracted to the ground. In fact, they are actually attracted to each other, but in such a small way that you can't tell unless you have a really expensive detector. In physics we call this magical attraction the "gravitational force". It's the force that holds you to the earth and keeps satellites up in the sky just the right way.

Well, the reason you can't detect the two bowling balls being attracted together is because you have to have a big object to really notice. A very smart man, Isaac Newton, figured out an equation a long time ago that showed how much that force depends on the size of something. I'll write it here: <code>F=G*M*m/d2</code>

All that really matters about that equation is that it's been used in just about everything you have ever seen built. Skyscrapers, houses, bridges, cars, you name it, everybody uses that equation to understand the universe.

So here is a question: What would have happened if Isaac Newton had patented his equations? Right now I could come up with an equation which explained how everything in the universe worked, and with it people could maybe make teleportation and flying cars and all the other things nerds dream about, but if I patented it, no one could use it without my permission.

Even if someone did years of research and came up with the same equations as me, they couldn't use them because I already patented them.

That's the stupidest thing I've heard in years.

I'm an engineer, and I will likely put years of research into figuring something out, but I am totally against patent law.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On rocket flight and dominion, a review of &quot;Space Flight&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just got done watching "Space Race", a four-part series which re-enacted the rise of rockets, starting from the early German V-2 series rocket and ending with the Apollo mission. It was most interesting, and was acted out quite skillfully, with high quality videography and the skillful use of actual stock footage to tie everything together.

Already being an avid fan and researcher of aircraft and rocketry, I found that the movie was very informative with respect to the processes involved, and that it very well showed the political and relational struggles which affected the development of rockets. It showed quite well the tension present within the Russian Soviet system: Betrayal and threats of torture and death were quite common, making it a very stressful environment.

One historical thing in particular I thought was interesting, concerning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>, the major designer for the rockets which propelled the Apollo moon mission. During World War II, von Braun was instrumental in the development and production of the V-2 rockets, which were produced at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelbau-Dora">Mittelbau-Dora</a>, the so-called "labor camp". This labor camp used roughly 60,000 prisoners, of which roughly 20,000 died mainly from disease and starvation.

The film, "Space Race", portrayed von Braun as having been on the research and development side, but not really in control of the labor camp. In fact, it showed von Braun as a man whose mind was set on one task only: To get a man to the moon.

However, one single quote in the film changed my mind of von Braun immediately: The narrator said that the United States government had documents which showed that von Braun chose <em>personally</em> that forced slave labor be used to build the V-2 rockets. The U.S. chose to classify the documents for quite some time, most assuredly to limit the already negative public response to hiring a Nazi.

Another thing I realized while watching this series was the enormous power used to get a satellite into space, and how terribly inefficient rocket thrust really is. Obviously it works, but the low efficiency of a rocket is what makes it necessary to carry so much fuel. In fact, this picture below shows that the useful load of the Saturn V rocket (used for the Apollo missions) compared to the actual rocket is miniscule!

While I (nerd that I am) have a definite desire to travel to Mars, I think the usual reasons of "for science!" are a terribly inadequate compensation for the immense cost. Some other method of thrust must be developed to make it feasible--this is being done, with varying degrees of success.

The second thing that I noticed from this film, was the incredibly strong political motivation for space flight. Obviously there is a military advantage to being able to have satellites that spy on other people, but the development of human space flight is terribly unnecessary, even for satellite repairs.

I have long hoped and dreamt that I would be able to visit Mars before I become "old", yet the more I shape my views of science according to the bible, the more I realize that "conquering the moon" is actually a violation of the dominion mandate:
<blockquote>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have <span>dominion</span> over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth." (Genesis 1:28)</blockquote>
Using huge resources to send someone to other planets or moons is, in fact, ignoring the dominion mandate altogether. Secondarily, it (currently) uses very large sums of money, taken from the taxpayer. I think that any true conservative who argues against the Health Care Bill should also argue against general space exploration being funded by the government.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For sale, by me, for a limited time only: Complete detailed plans for a fully functional nuclear power plant for a low cost of 120,000$. (Purchases made in bullion or in cash will receive <em>significant</em> discounts)

Nuclear power plants can be of great benefit to communities numbering in the 20,000 to 100,000. The cost of fuel is comparatively low, depending on your local governance, and in this earth-friendly culture, you can be sure that nuclear power plants produce little to no carbon or sulfur dioxides, a great benefit if you are still jockeying for a position in the U.N.

<strong>Completed plans will include:</strong>

Full architectural plans for a generic setup. (Desalinization plants for near-ocean operations will be extra, as will other non-standard add-ons, but can be provided.)

Detailed electronic control system schematics. (The safety mechanisms match those of the generation III models.)

Complete construction plans for assembly of the reactor core.

Additionally, full construction steps for the building construction can be supplied, at additional cost.

If you are interested in more detailed information, please contact me via my email.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day in class I got to thinking about where a true mad scientist might set up shop. Some of you have heard me ramble on about this before, but today I present to you an ordered list, starting from "not really mad" locations all the way to full blown insanity:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Out on the plains:</strong> Most people start here, usually as country folk who have to make do with what they have.</li>
	<li><strong>Up on the side of a mountain:</strong> Famous examples include Nikola Tesla.</li>
	<li><strong>On a deserted island:</strong> Once your shop gets raided, you start to seek refuge somewhere with fewer people.</li>
	<li><strong>Under the ocean:</strong> You can make your airplanes turn into submarines.</li>
	<li><strong>Inside a hollow mountain:</strong> Using the hopefully-dormant volcano as a power source is an obvious choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Orbiting the earth:</strong> The earth is a little crowded, let's step outside.</li>
	<li><strong>On the Moon:</strong> When orbiting the earth becomes boring, or maybe you need resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Out in the solar system:</strong> Earth government can reach the moon, better move a bit farther.</li>
	<li><strong>On the surface of the sun:</strong> Probably requires teleportation, likely a bit toasty.</li>
	<li><strong>Inside the sun:</strong> Because they can probably still see you on the surface.</li>
	<li><strong>Inside a black hole:</strong> The sun is too big and noticeable, and you can hide a (small) black hole anywhere!</li>
	<li><strong>In a parallel dimension:</strong> The gravitational waves of the black hole are picked up with the Hubble telescope.</li>
	<li><strong>In a fully separated dimension set:</strong> This one is probably on accident.</li>
</ul>
I'm sure examples of most of these already exist, especially in the comic book world.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rather Lengthy Windows 7 Review, by a Linux Fan</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2009/11/20/windows-7-review-by-linux-fan/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2009 05:38:25 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's important to note a difference between an Operating System (OS) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In the Apple system, the OS is a type of Unix, and the GUI is Snow Leopard. In the Ubuntu system, the OS is a type of Linux, and the GUI is Gnome. In the Microsoft system, originally the core was DOS, and the GUI was Windows. In XP the DOS core was finally removed, I don't know what it's called so I will call it WDOS.

This distinction is an important one, because when you install Snow Leopard, what you see and click on isn't really the OS, it's the GUI. This is especially apparent on systems like Ubuntu, which use a Debian/Linux OS, and can come with a multitude of GUIs: Gnome, KDE, Fluxbox, etc... However, in common terminology, normal people call Snow Leopard the Operating System, and when they test it they say "The OS doesn't have a good network connector program".

The use of the term, OS, is misused, but for good reason: The Operating System, to the normal person, is the thing you install from the disk. So when I review Windows 7, realize that I am actually testing the interface and not the core beneath it. I could test the actual core OS of Windows 7, but what I would be saying is things like "The CPU benchmarks run the Fibonacci sequence at a rate of so many sequences per second", which wouldn't be terribly helpful to normal people who just want to use the computer to "do stuff".

So I am really going to review the Graphical Interface of Windows 7, not the core Operating System.

<strong>A Note About Freedom</strong>

<strong></strong>I have used open source software for so long that I nearly returned Windows 7 on the License Agreement alone (EULA). I can appreciate the need to have a carefully drafted license, but one thing jumped out at me that I wish I could get clarification on: "You may only use the software on two processors at one time."

This pretty much excludes the i7 processor, and the new hex cores I keep hearing rumours about are definitely out. It doesn't even work if you say "processors" means CPU chips, since a quad core chip has four <em>processor </em>chips internally. In the case of a quad core, Microsoft can either cripple the computer by only using two of the four cores, or put you on the honor system. Either option is not acceptable, and if I had a quad core CPU, I can guarantee would be calling Microsoft for a refund, since I would be violating my agreement if I used more than two of the cores.

This is, I hope, a case of a poorly worded License, perhaps a copy-over from the old XP license. However, I would like to know if anyone has a quad core, whether they can confrim for sure that all four cores are in use by Windows?

<strong>Installation Notes</strong>

<strong></strong>The installation process was very simple and relatively pain free. I was even able to mess around with the partitions, although in this install I decided to let Windows take the whole 100 GB drive. The partition management options looked like, if I had some exotic ext4 partitions, that it would work around them. I also didn't try installing to a secondary partition, so no word on whether Windows has fixed that problem.

Full installation took only about 20 minutes, which was pretty nice.

<strong>Updating</strong>

As soon as I installed, Windows told me there were some updates available, which is pretty normal for a new OS. I poked around in that interface a bit and was pleasently surprised to see an improved interface over the XP design, with actual update packages visible and selectable in a very easy manner. There were some driver updates as well, so I installed all those and rebooted.

One thing that always annoyed me in XP was the stupid "Updates are ready" notification popping up every ten minutes or whatever. This has stopped with 7, which is nice. The notification pops up once on boot up, and leaves a small flag icon on the taskbar (you can remove that also, but I like to have a reminder visible).

<strong>Turning off the computer</strong>

This is as pain free as ever, and takes about as much time as before. If you use multiple users, there is no "Log off" option in the immediate Start Menu, you have to select the tiny arrow and then select "Log Off". Alternately (the faster way) is to hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete which brings up a prompt from which you can select "Log off".

<strong>Sharing Folders</strong>

I have four computers on my own private router, which connect to the main house router and to my roommate's computer. I share documents between the computers, so this was a big issue to test. On my XP laptop I placed a document in a new folder and then shared it, but 7 never could find it. I tried the mysterious "Homegroup", thinking it may be like the old "Workgroup", but had no luck. Eventually I was able to connect to my computer by typing my IP address in the Location Bar. I never actually could pull files off my laptop, but I can't be certain that wasn't a privacy setting on the laptop, so I won't take marks off for it since I was able to access the desktop folders from the laptop.

<strong>A Word on Appearance</strong>

Is it just me, or does the initial look seem really girlie? After looking at the clothing on the campus, I noted that apparently the swirly things are all the fad lately. I think they look girlie. Windows 7 has some pretty reasonable themes available, so I fixed that pretty quick.

One thing I was a bit disappointed on was the Logon Screen was not able to be changed without editing the registry. I think that is a style that the user should be able to change easily, so I will detract points for not having a complete "Style Suite" available. Good start, but still needs work.

Also, Windows has <em>finally</em> joined the modern age and included the option to have the desktop wallpapers rotate through a selection of images. Finally.

<strong>Turning Off System Sounds</strong>

I don't like the computer to make noise at me, it annoys me. To get to the sounds setup, Windows 7 has a pretty intuitive "Personalize" option when you right-click the desktop. The sound settings were there, which is a good place for them.

<strong>Installing Applications</strong>

The two things people really care about when they install a new OS are these: Do my programs work, and Does my hardware work?

I use a rather large suite of programs very consistently, so this was a good opportunity to test them out. This version of Windows 7 was the 64 bit version, so some of the programs didn't install until I downloaded the correct version, but here is a list of software that installed fine:

7-zip, AbiWord, Audacity, CCleaner, CPU-Z, DFraggler, Mozilla Firefox, Filezilla, foobar2000, the GIMP, Inkscape, IrfanView, Launchy (although I am noticing that I don't really need it anymore in 7), Notepad++, Open Office (installed without the Java extras), Pidgin, Spybot Search &amp; Destroy, Synergy, TortoiseSVN, Unlocker, VirtualBox, VLC, WampServer, Xiphos.

The only two things that didn't install fine were:

1) Easeus Partition Manager: The 32 bit version is free, but won't install on the 64 bit system. The 64 bit version costs money! I might end up paying for it, since it's a pretty good tool, although gParted is open source, which I like better.

2) PeerGuardian didn't install, even the Vista 64 bit version. My roommate told me to get PeerBlock instead, since PeerGuardian wasn't actually under development anymore. Installing PeerBlock was a snap!

<strong>The Windows Firewall</strong>

<strong></strong>I use the program Synergy to share a Keyboard+Mouse over TCP/IP. It's the handiest thing ever, I don't need a KVM switch! It installed and when I went to run it, Windows Firewall popped up and said "Do you want to allow Synergy?", so I said yes. And then it worked.

I don't know how secure the Firewall is, at it's core, but the interface was pretty clean. I poked around in the settings later, just to see what it was like, and it's pretty easy to maneuver.

<strong>Sharing Folders Across a Network, Round 2</strong>

I wanted to move some folders from my XP laptop to the desktop. I made a folder on the 7 computer, right clicked, and selected "Sharing", which allowed me to select three places: Homegroup read only, Homegroup read+write, or Everybody. I really have no clue what "Homegroup" is, but I wanted other people to be able to write, so I selected that. What happened next is one of the most aggravating things I have ever seen on an OS:

"You cannot share this folder"

And the only option is to click "OK".

This is not a Windows exclusive thing, bad design shows up in every OS I have ever used: If you are going to give me an error, <em>let me know something about it!</em> Anything at all, even a cryptic error code can be searched online, but this was very frustrating.

I tried again, and this time another option was available called "Advanced Sharing", which let me share the folder eventually. Then I went on my laptop and typed in <code>\\desktop</code> and was prompted for a login. That was weird, but I typed in the desktop logon and got access to the whole drive. Not the shared folder, the whole drive.

Network sharing continues to be a problem for me, it seems like Microsoft made a new sharing system and decided to not support other file sharing systems. Typical Windows snobbery, unfortunately, and makes me wonder how well supported the Linux SAMBA file system will work. I'm not very hopeful.

<strong>Networking Issues</strong>

While in the process of trying to set the desktop up with a static IP, I inadvertently disabled the actual hardware network device. In XP You can disable the network device from the "Network Connections" page, but the icon stays there. So far as I can tell (from about an hour of poking around) when you disable the network device from the "Network and Sharing Center", the only way to re-enable it is through the Device Manager, who is buried deep in the control panel.

The troubleshooting available was as summarily unhelpful as ever. When I couldn't figure out why my network didn't work, the Troubleshooter essentially said that nothing was wrong, and then offered to <em>look online</em> for more help. The humor is not lost on me, to be sure.

I have discussed my frustrations with networking issues quite strongly to the Kubuntu crowd when they installed a new, known-to-be-broken network manager application with their default OS install, so don't think I'm blindly hatin' on Windows. Windows 7 is an advance from the XP interface, but it still needs a few wrinkles ironed out.

<strong>Final Notes</strong>

Windows 7 suffers from the age-old problem of not being perfect.

If you were expecting to turn on your computer and have everything magically work for you, every time you did something, then you should either not use computers, or lower your expectations. Alternately you could get involved in software design/testing so you can do something about it, but that's not for most people.

That said, Windows 7 has a pretty reasonable interface, although I think they suffer from a "This is shiny, let's include it" mentality.

Your mileage may vary, of course, and people in the gaming community still have some driver issues going on, but those will be worked out relatively quickly.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I built a 64 bit computer a while back, and I decided to run Windows  on it, since my desire was to run SolidWorks and AutoCAD, two programs  that (because of the size and limited user base) are rather difficult to  get running in Linux. After about a half year of running and using  Windows 7 I  can say that I really want my Linux back.

Don't get me wrong, I  like Windows 7 pretty well--I even wrote <a href="http://www.davistobias.com/blog/665/windows-7-review-by-linux-fan">a  review</a> stating such. But most of the stuff I do on my home computer  is with coding, and Linux is really well suited for general coding and  scripting.

I have heard people say things like "If you want to get  any <em>real</em> work done, use <em>[operating system they like best]</em>"  but I don't feel this is a useful thing to say. It would be like saying  "If you want to get any <em>real</em> work done, grab a 16 pound sledge  hammer". The statement assumes what work you want to get done.

While  I <em>personally</em> will never buy a Mac, and I often complain about  the fanatical and rude (unknowingly, usually) fan base, I really think  that a professional photographer or video editor would be well served by  buying a Mac. Choosing the "right" operating system has a complicated  mix of variables, all really adding up to the general question: How hard  is it for me to get the job done that I am trying to do.

Running  SolidWorks or AutoCAD on a Ubuntu (my personal favorite) operating  system takes much more effort than doing the same thing on a Windows  machine. Laying the blame at different people won't do anything to  change the fact: Those two programs are designed in, and have support  only in Windows operating systems.

The past few months, however,  have caused me to realize that I don't actually need those programs on  my computer. I like to play with them, but they aren't necessary, and I  probably won't use them very much, honestly.

So I'm moving back to  Linux.

I'm moving back because the environment is best for the  type of things I do on my computer, things that the average computer  might classify as "hacking", but to a knowledgeable person are just  coding and developing scripted programs.

But mainly I'm moving  back because I miss the <em>environment of freedom</em> that an Open  Source operating system has.

So that's it, and now I have to  get the 64 bit operating system running, which shouldn't take long.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was supposed to be asleep an hour and a half ago, according to my  strict self-imposed schedule, but I had to tell <em>you</em> this story of  what happened today:

This afternoon I was sitting in the study lounge at school, working on  some rather difficult homework, when something clicked in my head and I  looked up with a sudden realization:

"Dude! I'm in school for <em>engineering</em>!"

This has happened only once before, since I've been here at UNL: I was  just be minding my own business and I suddenly realize where I am and  what I'm doing. Sounds strange? Let me fill you in:

When I was ten years old, I distinctly remember my first real birthday  party. It was fun, and I made my friend cry, but it's not that important  to what I'm telling you. What <em>is</em> important, for the purposes of  this story, is that I also distinctly remember studying physics. Yes, I  studied physics and the physical sciences as early as ten. I wouldn't  say I really understood them, since my notes from that time consist of  mostly "put magic chemical A and magic chemical B into this thing, and  AWESOME stuff comes out!"

(I'm not generalizing about that--I really wrote that. And I was  serious.)

I have always been like this, but somewhere along the road of life I  lost sight of this dream I had. I had always wanted to build stuff, <em>magical</em> stuff probably, but I got into cooking instead and spent nine or so  years there. I'm not complaining, and I'm definitely not dissing  cooking--I would still love to open a restaurant someday.

What I'm saying is that today, for the first time since I've been at  school, I realized with a sense of clarity that I am doing exactly what  I've always wanted to do and learning exactly what I've always wanted to  learn.

I'm probably going to cry out of joy: Dudes and Dude-ettes, <em>I am  totally in school for engineering!</em>

I was just so stoked that I had to tell somebody, and I thought I would  share my excitement with all of you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got this single bottle about mid-summer after my experience with Boulevard's "Lunar Ale". The Lunar Ale had a smooth finish with hints of yeast, and the local grocer (Hy-Vee has a great selection and a knowledgeable staff) said this beer had an even stronger yeast finish.

A gentle pour gave a three-finger foam head, which settled down with no lacing after about ten minutes. It's a bit darker than most wheat beers I've had, but still has rich golden hues. Aroma is mildly fruity, distinctly a wheat. It drinks pretty smooth, definitely has a citrus hint, yeast aftertaste is present, but not very noticeably.

In all a pleasant drink, but there are definitely beers with an equal taste that cost less. The fruity scent is more defined than either Boulevard's "Lunar Ale" or Fat Tire's Ale, but otherwise it's pretty similar. This has been in my fridge for a few months, so it's possible that the flavor diminished over that time.

		<title>A New Piano Technique</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2009/09/13/a-new-piano-technique/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you know of any more people who would be interested in this  techniques, please pass them a link or whatever.

Tonight, <a href="http://www.joshduff.com">Josh Duff</a>, my house-mate, suggested a new technique for  practicing the piano: Cover the keys while you practice, using cardboard  or something similar, that way you can't see the keys while you play.

I tried it by taping a piece of cardboard with painters tape (no  residue) so that I could read the sheet music, but not see the keys.  Additionally, I taped a few "markers" to the keys, so I could feel "home  row", much like a computer keyboard. These didn't help as much as I  thought, but more on that later.

Some things I noticed after practicing a worship song and some sheet  music for an hour or so:

This method forces you to rely on seeing and feeling the steps between  notes, translating what you see as, for example, a 3 step on the sheet  music to a 3 step on the keys. You really stop thinking of what letter  key you are playing and focus very strongly on intervals.

Also, you really have to pay attention to the feel of the keys more. For  example, when you jump down an octave, you need to feel the difference  between the three blacks and the two blacks to tell you where you are.  The brain can interpret the muscle enough where you can tell which  octave you are in, like the two octave down from middle C, but large  steps make you lose location enough where you would have to feel your  way around to find, for example, A#, two octaves down from middle C. I  suppose that you would probably develop muscle memory after a while, but  until then...

I often play lazy by not thinking ahead or watching the sheet music for  when I should be playing whatever notes. This is a bad habit I  developed, and it required a serious mental effort to work around it  with the covered keys, since I had to think ahead much more carefully.

The "key markers" were just pieces of tape stuck to the C key to help me  feel my way around. I tried using them at first, but they don't help  you very much, since you don't want to move your hand *up* to the C  marker and then *down two steps, for example, since it will make your  playing slower. I found myself relying on the two-versus-three black key  setup to feel my way around.

If you are a piano player, I would recommend trying this, and I would  recommend trying it two ways: Try it on a song you know, and don't need  sheet music for. Then try it on something that you don't really know  very well, and you rely on sheet music to play it.

I know it took some serious mental effort from me, but I expect those  who play the piano more frequently will have an easier time of it.

Let me know how it goes!

Try this covered key technique and tell me how hard it was.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reformed/Calvinist theology, yes or no?</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2010/04/24/reformed-or-calvinist-theology/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A friend of mine asked the question (summarized) "why do you hold to the Reformist/Calvinist view?" The answer that I started writing became so long that it wouldn't fit inside a Facebook comment, and I thought it might be better to post it here. It is pretty well assumed that if someone is serious about there faith, that they think their belief to be most Biblical, so the answer "I like this belief because it is most Biblical" are not very helpful. With that in mind, here is my answer:

While the things that I believe probably line up with "Reformed" or "Calvinist" doctrine, and in a discussion I might call myself one of those if it would speed up the conversation (but in accordance with the following statement), I hesitate to call my belief by any particular name other than "Christian" and, more specifically, "Bible believing". It's not that I am ashamed in some way about what I believe, or that I necessarily have disagreements with some of the beliefs within that group, only that people have their own understanding of the word—many times having an unfounded negative stereotype.

The most important thing to me is, as you said, that whatever view I hold to be as close to a completely scriptural view as possible and I do think that "Calvinist"/"Reformed" doctrine is the closest to the Bible, or I would not be in such easy agreement with it's doctrines. While I think that this alone would be argument persuasive enough to keep me "in the fold", as it were, there is one more thing which makes my agreement in greater solidarity: A "full" view of scripture.

The denomination which I came from (Berean/Baptist) focused primarily on the teachings in the New Testament, which I do admire, but they did so at a cost of neglecting the words of the Old Testament. I do not speak only of what the preacher preached upon, that he never preached from the Old Testament, but rather that the whole of the Old Testament (except, perhaps, the prophecies of Christ, the Messiah) was largely implicitly thought of as "past tense" or even perhaps "no longer useful for teaching". Two thirds of what we call "The Bible" was largely examined as a mere trinket, nearly on the level of the works of Nostradamus.

Of course, I am being a bit harsh and strong-tongued on this point, and I will no doubt be reminded of teachings that I heard which were from the Old Testament. In fact, my parents regularly required us to read and study the Psalms and Proverbs. But it was the fact that, when one wanted to study serious thoughts—what I now recognize as the study of theology—one would not examine the Old Testament.

When I was introduced to a theological view (baptism) the person discussing it with me did not turn exclusively to Hebrews or Romans, but rather showed me how the verses of baptism through the whole Bible were all presenting the same picture, and how the view of baptism in the New Testament was portrayed in the same manner as that of the Old. This view of scripture is a full and comprehensive view, in that it doesn't examine a single verse or chapter, or even a single book, without examining it from the context of the whole scripture.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Caleb, good questions. It has been over two years since I wrote this but, although my thoughts have definitely matured since then, the essence of it remains.

My main response when people say "do you believe in X?" is that I believe exactly what the Bible teaches. Of course, as I said in the post above, that isn't exactly helpful, so let me answer the question "Do you think the Bible teaches that infant baptism is correct?"

Yes, I think the Bible teaches that infant baptism is the thing to do.

The Bible is clear that it is not baptism that saves, so what is baptism for? What is the purpose? What does the symbolism mean?

For a very thorough answer on infant baptism, you can download a free PDF that talks about infant baptism <a href="http://www.biblicalblueprints.org/pamphlets/seven-biblical-principles-that-call-for-infant-baptism/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

In brief, however, the thing that I noted was that most people ignore what the Old Testament says about baptism. It has quite a bit to say on the matter, so a person truly wanting to learn should just do a quick word study on baptism in the Old Testament.

Here is an excerpt from the linked pamphlet:

<blockquote>Paul made clear that he had been “saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come” (Acts 26:22; cf. Heb. 3:5; Acts 17:11). Thus, every New Testament doctrine (including baptism) was anticipated in the Old Testament so that the new is in the Old concealed and the old is in the New revealed.</blockquote>]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When you speak of a theological view of baptism in your last paragraph, what do you mean?  Do you believe in infant baptism?

Just so you know, I am quite reformed in my theology as well; but I believe that baptism is for believers (obviously, some who claim belief are baptized and later prove to not have been of the faith, but that's not really the issue).  I understand the covenant issue relating baptism and circumcision, but the New Covenant is a better covenant (Hebrews 8)--it's not the exact same!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These night pathways shine back the pale lights with an unseemly sheen,
the empty streets seem a fragile reflection
of my own emptiness.

A moonless night is testimony to the man I once was.
The shadow remains, but only from
the cold and lifeless halogen bulbs.

And yet, as I stand
(melancholy) looking down
from this wind swept bridge to the road below,
I am interrupted by a gleaming light
and a howling sound.

As wind sweeps this chilled frame a voice comes from behind:
My soliloquy is interrupted
by a police officer who wonders
why I am talking to my empty cup of malted ice cream.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been getting "the muse" lately, and writing down an outline for a music album I've been thinking of for a long time. I have a couple of the songs written into lyrics, and I know in general how I want them to sound, but I think it will take some time to get them there.

When I write down poetry I don't usually do it for the benefit of others, but instead I write thoughts and emotions into what I consider a sort of abstracted form. Poetry <em>is</em>abstract, you know?

Often I write down poetry and verse knowing that it will fade away or be discarded: A few verses I wrote on a plastic sheet hidden between pages of a book, knowing that the words would be smudged away after a time. Strangely enough, I would consider these now-discarded writings to be some of my best pieces, yet I let them decay rapidly with time and never share them.

I don't say this to boast in any way, but to point out a strange eccentricity that I have: Some of my best creative work I purposely hide from others and put it in such a way that it will not last.

Why do I do this? Frankly I am not entirely sure myself, but I do think it has made me a better writer in some ways. Judge for yourselves, I suppose.

Now I am trying to get into creating music, and I am finding it hard to do. I am passionate about music: Music is my drug of choice.

Over this summer I'll be hashing out some music and eventually releasing an album here, as well as placing it on some well known torrent sites for ease of distribution. In the process I will be looking for talented musicians who would be willing to play bits and pieces for the album. I'm not going to be the main singer, I want other people who are better at singing to sing the more important parts.

All I know is that music is confusing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have spent the past few days in Omaha, visiting a few friends but mostly doing some web-site design work. It was very nice to hang out with my family for a couple afternoons, that hasn't happened in a long time.

While I was in Omaha, working and relaxing, I also worked out a list of the things I have planned for the summer. This is an incomplete list, and some of the things are very generalized (e.g., how much do I need to know before I can say I have learned Chinese?) but it should be pretty close. Let me know if I'm missing anything obvious:
<ul>
	<li>Pick an emphasis within my major (Mechanical Engineering) and list <em>all</em> available companies</li>
	<li>Repair/restore my Geo metro (<a href="http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/active/89-geo/">project page</a>, more details posted there)</li>
	<li>Sell everything I have on both porches (lots of car parts)</li>
	<li>Prepare for the <a href="http://www.ncees.org/">FE exam</a> in October</li>
	<li>Finish political strategy plan (related to <a href="http://www.religiouspolitic.com/">this</a>)</li>
	<li>Lay out full first draft of math book</li>
	<li>Find and use an actual accounting/budget program</li>
	<li>Build and polish the <a href="http://biblicalblueprints.org/">BB</a>/<a href="http://dominioncovenantchurch.com/">DCC</a> website redesign</li>
	<li>Learn <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a>, and Chinese (spoken)</li>
	<li>Finish writing music album, record first draft</li>
	<li>Purchase and learn the cello</li>
	<li>Register for classes and generate the full two semester schedule</li>
	<li>Find and use a project/task management software</li>
	<li>Invent nuclear battery</li>
	<li>Keep being so awesome</li>
</ul>
School starts on August 23, which gives me about 110 days to get all that done. Well, what do you have planned for the summer?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my <a href="http://www.davistobias.com/blog/985/summer-plans">previous post</a> I made a list of goals I desire to accomplish this summer, my roommate (Josh) telling me I overestimated my ability to Get Things Done. So in an effort to clarify, both for you the casual reader and myself as well, I describe in more detail my plans. On my wall I have a paper grid, 31 columns wide and 12 rows high, which represent the whole year. When I wake up I cross off the previous days box, which has made me realize more acutely how much time I waste. Side note: I just (this very second) had to clean out my keyboard so the "z" would stop typing. Cleaning old keyboards is gross. Ugh.

Anyway, so here is the list from the other day, numbered now:
<ol>
	<li>Pick an emphasis within my major (Mechanical Engineering) and list <em>all</em> available companies</li>
	<li>Repair/restore my Geo metro (<a href="http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/active/89-geo/">project page</a>,  more details posted there)</li>
	<li>Sell everything I have on both porches (lots of car parts)</li>
	<li>Prepare for the <a href="http://www.ncees.org/">FE exam</a> in  October</li>
	<li>Lay out full first draft of math book</li>
	<li>Find and use an actual accounting/budget program</li>
	<li>Learn <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a>, and Chinese (spoken)</li>
	<li>Purchase and learn the cello</li>
	<li>Register for classes and generate the full two semester schedule</li>
	<li><del datetime="2010-05-30T05:44:29+00:00">Find and use a project/task management software</del> Done!</li>
	<li>Build and polish the <a href="http://biblicalblueprints.org/">BB</a>/<a href="http://dominioncovenantchurch.com/">DCC</a> website redesign</li>
	<li>Finish writing music album, record first draft</li>
	<li>Finish political strategy plan (related to <a href="http://www.religiouspolitic.com/">this</a>)</li>
	<li><del datetime="2010-05-30T05:44:29+00:00">Invent nuclear battery</del> Research ticket filed</li>
	<li><del datetime="2010-05-30T05:44:29+00:00">Keep being so awesome</del> Be even more awesome!</li>
</ol>
And here is that list expanded to explain in more detail:
<ol>
	<li>After deciding on an emphasis within the Mechanical Engineering world, create a database or a simple spreadsheet of as many companies within that field as I can find. Narrow this list into: 10 companies I would like to start working for as an intern or intro level engineer, and 10 companies to stay with through most of my career. Generate and keep files on these 20 companies, and shape a resume for each of the first 10.</li>
	<li>I had a more complete list that I still needed to prioritize, but the main things are: Rust treatment inside and out, install spare tire cover, install carpet, install seat covers, replace rear wheel hubs (bearings are going out, upgraded used hubs is about the same cost), polish headlights (they are oxidized, reducing light). Finances will limit the final list a lot.</li>
	<li>Clean and photograph everything to sell on eBay/craigslist, write up descriptions for them, pre-package for shipping and store inside. The main goal is to have the covered porch empty of everything except yard tools and possibly my bicycle.</li>
	<li>Get a prep book from the Engineering Library, study review 3 times per week for 10-30 minutes each time. My brother may want to get in on the action (also an ME).</li>
	<li>The math book project can be found <a href="http://www.baconmath.com/wiki">here</a>. The goal is a rough draft, including the entire series from start to finish with every major section (e.g., "Calculus") and every Sub-Section (e.g., "row reduction of matrices") labeled, and with a single paragraph for each of these sections. (No problems/solutions/examples)</li>
	<li>I want to be able to track every penny I spend and receive, and be able to design a budget of monthly expenses, as well as longer term goals and so on. I actually bought the <a href="http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/active/zipit-z2/">Zipit Z2</a> for this, but it isn't quite up to speed without special software design. It's complicated, that's all.</li>
	<li>I don't intend on being proficient in any of these by the end of the summer, but rather I intend to have a reasonable grasp of Python/C++, so I can sit down and know the general syntax etc. If the finances are available in time I would like to take the second semester (summer session) of Chinese, but my main goal is to have learned the set of flash cards I made for the last semester's class. It's about 100 basic words, and a few dozen common phrases.</li>
	<li>This one will be more difficult, since saving up for the purchase might take most of the summer. I think I might switch this goal to just plain acquiring the cello in the first place. Of course, if anybody has a cello I can borrow for the whole summer that would be  awesome. If that were the case, then I want to be able to sight read simple music from sheet music by the end of the summer.</li>
	<li>Get all scheduling written down both on a printable spread sheet, so that a single semester can be placed on the wall, and also imported into my calendar of choice: Google Calendars. Include all holidays, breaks, and so on, that are listed at the school website.</li>
	<li>I have already started looking into this one and have not had much success. Most project management software is either: For large corporations (and so are usually too complex to learn quickly) or they are too simple and don't have the things I need. If someone has knowledge of a web-based personal project management that is more powerful than the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">GTD</a> method, but wouldn't require more than an hour to learn, let me know. (Software, general projects, vehicle maintenance, etc.)</li>
	<li>This is pretty straightforward. I just realized that a nice touch would be to support versioning in the template (I use Wordpress as a CMS, which is awesome). I'll have to check into that...</li>
	<li>I have an idea for an album of about six songs which I would like to record and polish this summer. Truthfully, however, this item is quickly dropping in priority.</li>
	<li>I have a whole host of ideas, some very concrete and some nebulous, and they all need to be gelled into a single unified strategy plan. Seeing as how this is so nebulous, my goal is: Make this not nebulous <em>at all</em>.</li>
	<li>I am officially entering this as an active research project.</li>
	<li>While this was meant to be funny, I was actually serious. My goal: Build a real habit of daily Bible reading, prayer, and worship. This means I won't be able to stay up late anymore (it's 3:10 right now).</li>
</ol>
So there are my goals. I already nearly crossed one of those off the listâ€”since I can't find a project management software that I like, I am just clarifying the design specification system that I am already using to include a system of progress reports. This system is generally reasonable since I can access the project files from other computers over <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>, my favorite backup software. I pay for the higher space, and I have a second free account which lets me put a portable version of DropBox on a 2GB thumbdrive and sync active projects that way.

I should also be done with one of those websites within the week, so that makes 1.5 crossed off the list already. Only 102 days left!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This summer I am trying out a <a href="http://www.davistobias.com/blog/988/summer-plans-expanded">list of goals</a>, that way I can feel more productive. So far I've completed the #10 goal of a project management program.

I looked around online for quite some time, and tried out a few project management softwares, but all of them were too complex for what I had in mind. I just want a way to track how many projects I have active at any one time, and a way to take notes on how the project progresses. I already had a system of folders that I used, but nothing terribly exciting.

Sadly, I never did find a good program. The most promising thing I found was a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-project/">plugin for WordPress</a>, but it hadn't been updated for a couple years and required a little poking to even get working. At first I thought that I might be able to modify that plugin to do what I want, but then I remembered a truth which I am still struggling to apply to my life:

The more time I spend doing this one thing, the less time I have to do other awesome things.

In the end I decided to just clarify the existing protocol for my own system of folders and notes, and since I use <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">DropBox</a> to backup my data, every project is accessible at any internet point. One extra thing I did is use <a href="http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=7729">DropBox portable</a>, that way I can even access my projects when I don't have internet access. Since I actually pay for DropBox, and use about 30GB of space, and since the biggest portable drive I have is an 8GB thumb drive, I decided to sign up for a second DropBox account (the free one is 2GB) and use that one on the portable drive. Now, by sharing that account with my paid account, I can keep all the projects synchronized and accessible at any computer location.

I also started on several of the other projects, the <a href="http://www.dominioncovenantchurch.com">DCC website</a> design in particular is nearing completion.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fame and fortune, and Twitter.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I've been thinking about the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a>. Pretty much everybody online does it: Twitter is very common, but even Facebook status updates are a type of microblog.

In particular I have been thinking about how we try to write the things we do into something "interesting". Life is rather boring, most of the time, and we don't ever write about the things that are uninteresting, instead we may spice it up with funniness or in other ways make it less boring sounding.

Many people have told me that they think Twitter is just inane things like "Thinking about picking my nose", but even if we discard the generalized fact that they haven't actually tried it out, I think we miss the point if we try to defend Twitter by saying that interesting things do exist. I think we miss the point because of this: Normal conversation is pretty similar.

In conversation we don't normally talk about things that we don't think are interesting. If I'm talking to my room mate, we probably won't talk about how I sat in my chair for several hours and pretty much did nothing. Instead we will talk about the things that are interesting: I found this video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4OnhnvczTk">Epic Beard Man</a>, and examined the design of an interesting <a href="http://www.markdijkstra.eu/">single page web</a>. Even so, normal conversation is filled up with what could likely be called inane chatter.

So what does it mean, that we don't talk about boring things? I don't know, actually.

There's an old saying that a person is more than the sum of the parts, but that isn't to say the parts aren't important. Since a lot of life is pretty boring, and we don't talk about the boring things, that means we don't talk about a lot of <em>life</em>.

That's why I decided to get a Twitter account and only post things which I thought were boring. Things that I probably wouldn't talk about because they weren't interesting.

It's hard, because I'm only used to talking about things that I think may be interesting, but you can read it here: <a href="http://twitter.com/normalboring">@normalboring</a>

In the past I tried using Twitter, but I stopped because it didn't benefit me. In this case I am using it as a sort of study, to see what happens when a person only talks about the inane and boring things in life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I often write little snippets of poetry/prose, yet I have been unsatisfied with presenting some of them as plain text: The writing itself, along with some accompanying sketches, is an important part of some of my compositions.

Not many, mind you, but enough that I am not satisfied with using the existing Wordpress blog as the method of presentation.

However, I really <em>really</em> like the Wordpress framework, so I am reluctant to move away from it. If I were to use HTML to display what I want, and use Wordpress as the management system, I would basically need to either have separate CSS (or perhaps even Themes) for each page within the category, or create an image for the bits of creative writing that require precision "artistic" placement.

I think I'll just go with the second choice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently there has been quite a bit of <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/38145.html">discussion in the news</a> about the launch of a privately owned (as privately as possible, I should say) space satellite. Ever since Obama changed the focus/strategy of NASA, with a supposed emphasis (it's really just a big shell game: NASA's budget actually increased) of privately owned satellites, there has been argument from every side about what this means.

One particular article I read was by <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/opinion/article/opinion-spacex-launch-shows-promise-of-private-space-travel/19507028">AOL News</a> which commented in particular on Senator Richard Shelby (Alaska) who, to summarize, doesn't like Obama's new NASA policy and doesn't think the private market can handle the launching and maintenance of satellites. While I could comment on the peculiar fact that Senator Shelby is a Republican, and that he should be more enthusiastic about private ownership of previously federal programs, instead I will point out something else.

Senator Shelby essentially said that the space company, SpaceX, wouldn't be able to launch a satellite. When they did so successfully, and put a payload into perfect orbit, he is quoted assaying that the launch only replicated what NASA accomplished in 1964.

This is an unfortunate truth, but should be considered with additional details: That's basically all NASA is doing today as well.

What I mean is this: For all the awesome things NASA has been doing, they really are stuck back in the same technology and inner bureaucracy that they had back in <em><strong>late 60's</strong></em>.

Think of this: It was almost 40 years ago that we launched some dudes to the moon, but if we tried now we wouldn't even be able to. Estimates I have read say that it would take 10 years to get <em>ready</em> for a moon launch.

My point isn't about whether we should go to the moon or not, I'm only saying that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's time to let NASA go</span>.

All the people working at NASA are very intelligent, they have the know-how to start a new company. In fact, the recent private launch by SpaceX was done by mostly old NASA employees.

But I can hear you asking: What about the International Space Station? We can't just let it go, can we?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The use of the internet has been widely increased and there hasn't been much discussion on what long term difficulties may be introduced because of the increased dependence. One particular issue I've noted is that blog posts, even high quality posts, have a much shorter thesis length.

Make a proposition, defend and examine the proposition: This is a thesis. In a book the thesis is on the order of several hundred pages, but in a blog it's on the order of several hundred words. I suppose that even status updates (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) could be considered a thesis, just much shorter.

This shortened thinking is acceptable at times, but I propose that it is detrimental to ones mental intelligence to ignore lengthy thesis. Thesisis. Multiple of them.

Anyway.

When one uses the internet, it is usually to read medium length thesis (blog posts) or short length thesis (status updates), but not often to read lengthy thesis (book size). I know that I do this, and I am realizing more recently that this has built in me a mindset of laziness. This bothers me greatly.

I'm not exactly sure what needs to be done, so over the next couple weeks I will be analyzing my internet useage and trying to determine how it should change.

The RSS reader mechanism is a great way to keep up to date with friends, if they post blog updates for example, and maybe paying attention to "the news" (I don't do this at all) might be a good thing, so I think I'll try to limit my internet useage to that.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I drove up from my house to North Platte to go to a friends funeral in the morning.

I heard about the death through Facebook which, I must say, is not the greatest of ways to hear that a friend died. Of course, there's probably no good way to give the news.

For some reason I am having a hard time convincing myself that this is real. I'm still not sure what to think. Or how to feel.

Many of my friends have died, so in a way I'm used to it. But am I emotionless because I've been hardened by exposure? No, that's not it at all. Death still affects me very strongly, in a deep emotional way.

The last funeral I remember was for a friend's wife who I never really knew, and, to be completely honest, I hadn't seen the guy in so many years I mistook him for his older brother. That was embarrassing. I went to that funeral sort of as a show of support, and also because the news really hit me hard. It's been a long time since I've wept such tears. Why did that death affect me so much?

Those without faith might say that the sorrow is that of separation, that I am in sorrow because I'll never see the person again. But what of those of the faith? We know that, if a person has been justified, we will see them again.

So on the one hand I could say something ultra-spiritual like "I am not weeping because I know I'll see this person again." But that's not why.

I guess it's just because I don't really think it's real. Intellectually I "know" it to be true: I've heard the news from multiple people. But inside I guess...]]></content:encoded>

That is enough of that, I guess. The funeral is over, I wasn't able to visit with many friends. Maybe next week at the wedding we can meet over happier circumstances.

I know so many women who are in bad situations, or who have emotional damage, and I want to help them. I want to help guys as well, but since they lock away their emotions I just can't see them as well.

I have been driving in this heat for too long, and no air cooling has made me super sweaty and exhausted.

Church tomorrow!]]></content:encoded>

&nbsp;

The development of computer interface icons has traditionally followed the office metaphor—icons were designed to look like the analogous office object. (See <a href="http://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/theory/know-your-icons-part-1-a-brief-history-of-computer-icons/">this link </a>for a graphical example.) Collections of objects were put into containers, similar to how papers were grouped into folders, so we made folder icons. Data organization in general has followed the office metaphor since the first GUI desktop.

Music and video files are also stored in containers called folders, but the analogy is not as descriptive. Mix tapes and VHS tapes were never stored inside manila folders, so a more accurate metaphor may have been a bookshelf container. Fundamentally, how data is physically stored on hard drives does not mimic folder structure, with large files being fragmented across large physical areas of discs.

Although the folder metaphor may not be perfect, it has been successful largely because the hierarchical organization of data is something the human mind naturally understands. I have a music container, a picture container, a container for my books and writings, and so on. Within those containers I have smaller containers, with my documents container being divided into a dozen or more sub-containers.

In real life the same structure is made, with silverware in a kitchen drawer which is further organized into compartments for forks, knives, and spoons. Bookshelves are usually sorted alphabetically or by category. This tendency to use hierarchical structure seems to be part of human nature.

But as data is increasingly stored and synchronized across multiple locations, and as applications become better at helping us organize our data, there has been a shift from folder organization to an application based system. People use Picasa for managing their pictures, or iTunes for managing their music, and don't even navigate folders anymore. New synchronization protocols, like the Zune wireless sharing system, are making it unnecessary to navigate to folders even when sharing or moving data.

While I spend a good amount of time keeping my folders of music organized and carefully sorted, my friend organizes his music by dragging it into iTunes. I appreciate consistent and strict folder structure, as does he, but since he only looks at his music collection through iTunes, he doesn't care about the folder structure of his music.

This shift from strict folder organization has allowed for another method: Tags. You can organize your music collection from genre to artist name with a single click, and it doesn't matter what the underlying folder structure is. Using tags instead of folders made my email organization much easier: I didn't need to decide if a letter was work or administrative related, now I give the email both tags and find it later using either one.

Doing web design work has taught me much about databases, which <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">do</span> should not use the strict hierarchical organization method, but instead use extra tables as "go betweens" to match lists of data with other lists of data. This method is yet another way of organizing data, and can be incredibly efficient when compared to other methods.

The hierarchical visualization of data is how we see data naturally, and it's why <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/">good visualizations</a> on subjects can cause breakthroughs of understanding. The recent change from analog to digital opens up new and exciting organizational visualizations, making single structures no longer required.

In fact, strict folder organization is something that I am glad to see leave. That way I won't need to decide if Yo-Yo Ma playing some Bach cello solos should be in the "Bach" folder or the "Yo-Yo Ma" folder.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[School started again today, at the University, and in one of my classes is a man that I met last year. Actually, there are many people in each class that I know from last year.

When I saw all these people who I hadn't seen for a few months, my heart was lifted and I was happy. I found joy in seeing again these friends, and even in seeing these people who I barely know.

There are friends I have who I considered very close, and although we have been apart quite some time and still hold them in high regard. How much more will my heart be lifted, when I am able to see these friends face to face? And how much more when, on that final day, I see the closest friend face to face?

Joy unspeakable.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An Incredible Loss</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will never forget.

The words are common now, almost enough to be a cliche, but they mark a sentiment which runs deep in America.

The loss of the human lives wasn't the only thing that gripped at the hearts of people worldwide, it was the suddenness and closeness of the attack. Certainly the number of people inside the buildings was a large part of the emotional response, but I think it was the incredulity that such a thing could even occur.

Forever burned in the minds of every American who saw: The buildings falling, the people jumping, the dust, the sweat. Heroes everywhere helping the fallen, searching for the lost.

And then...

It was nothing sudden, a slow change over the years. A people overtaken by a battle against an enemy with no name.

Remember our troops.

God bless America.

Land of the free, because of the brave.

Complex arguments simplified to fit on bumper stickers.

Lengthy thoughts on war and freedom and difficult subjects which have filled many books, all of it discarded and set aside. Scholars who have studied these ideas, warriors who have lived out these philosophies, all their words and ideas were put aside and a loud clamor filled the air.

Pictures of war fill the television screens, and videos of war fill the internet. Everyone voicing their opinions and thoughts, but no one looking behind the curtain of ignorance.

People say "Never Forget" and point to the loss of life.

People say "Remember our troops" and point to this one event, September 11th.

Many years from now people will look back and remember September 11th, not for the loss of lives, but for the response that followed. Confusion and fear outweighed the desire for freedom from oppression and we passed laws to let government creep into our daily lives.

We let the government listen to our phone calls so we could have a little peace of mind. We accepted the personal searches at airports so we could fly in safety. We let police search our homes without serious cause so we could be assured our neighbors weren't going to kill us.

No law was passed and no significant change was made, but now, nine years later, we accept government intrusion and control. Most people are even ignorant of why this loss is a bad thing.

September 11th, 2001: I will never forget.

On that day I didn't see two towers fall, I saw my freedom and my liberty finally collapse.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A turmoil of emotions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sunday night when I got home I watched a movie I had been holding in que. The movie is called "Secret", or "不能说的秘密" in Chinese, the language it was originally released in. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Standard-DVD-Jay-Chou/dp/B000W8LX5G">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037850/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_%282007_film%29">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008935-secret/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.) I had seen a music video on YouTube called "Dandelion's Promise", and the story in the lyrics was personally very moving. You can view the music video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5pCGOI-LqU">here</a>, but I don't know that it will be as moving to you.

I don't want to talk much about the movie because I feel that if I talk about it too much you'll think too highly of it. Don't get me wrong: It was a great movie. A romance with a twist, and a beautiful ending. But I just doubt that it will provoke such a strong response in most people. I don't know, try it and see I guess.

What I really wanted to say is that after I watched this movie, I sat there for about an hour in silence and then I wept. I honestly do not think I am exaggerating when I say that I have never cried so hard in my life. For a good hour I wept and a deep sorrow covered my heart.

Friends, let me tell you why this grown man of twenty-seven wept so openly and sorrowed so deeply. There are two reasons, and they are both extremely personal.

The first reason is largely sentimental, and I could simplify by saying that the love portrayed in this story brought up memories of my own experience of love, and reminded me of the pain of letting go. I know it sounds cheesy, but sometimes the only way to describe emotions is with cheesy sounding phrases. That night I wept out of pain, and that sorrow was perhaps that much more bitter because I had tasted a small portion of that intimacy.

The second reason, and the one that hit me harder the more I thought about it, was simply this: I am so far from being the man I desired to be. My struggles with pride, with self-control, with the lust of the flesh—all of these battles I had hoped would be much farther, yet I still succumb to the same temptation that I have in the past. But even more, I had wanted to be a man who loved God and loved others with all I have.

And I don't.

Perhaps you'll give me some reason why I shouldn't feel so down. Give me some assurance of something.

I know, I know. Intellectually I know, and in my heart I know. But something about this movie made me feel something in my deepest of emotions that I haven't felt for a long time.

Sometimes I talk to people about movies that make them cry, but no one ever seems willing to say exactly <em>why</em> the movie made them cry. Well, I left a lot of the details out, but this was my best attempt. To be honest, I'm still processing this movie, I cry every time I think much about it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My friends: It comes to my attention that the Department of Homeland Security has begun shutting down websites based on whether they believe they can get away with it.

The situation is complex, but absolutely critical. Essentially the decision that stands before us is whether or not the internet should be directly controlled by the government, thereby regulating the freedom of press. Such a statement is certainly simplification, but in my study of the issue, I am certain this simplification is an accurate one.

My aim is not a political one, I don't speak as a Republican, a Democrat, a Conservative, a Liberal, an Anarchist, or any other type. I only speak this as a warning to those who cherish free speech: If this movement by the Homeland Security is not both stopped and overthrown, it will signify the final loss of freedom of press in America, and I do not feel that I am exaggerating in the least.

I have yet to find a way to combat this egregious violation by the HSA, but letters and emails and phone calls to your representative are always something useful, even if they provide little result.

For freedom.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone, in keeping with my <a href="http://www.davistobias.com/blog/985/summer-plans">public planning</a> mood, I thought I would write up my plans for the winter break. The summers plans were a little too much, but I think this one I planned out about right. (Not in order of importance)
<ul>
	<li>Finish Wordpress "<a href="http://www.tobiaslabs.com/category/projects/sermon-posts-plugin/">Sermon Posts</a>" plugin and make project public</li>
	<li>Finish Wordpress Product Management plugin</li>
	<li>Some work for my church, mostly moving the sermons over to the new plugin</li>
	<li>I have a couple web clients to finish work for, and a few to propose working for</li>
	<li>I bought a trailer in preparation for moving this summer, so I need to move all my junk lying around in the house into the trailer, which also needs a few repairs</li>
	<li>Belated fall cleaning of the house</li>
	<li>Quite a few clothes need mending, thankfully I am good with a needle and thread</li>
	<li>Get some quality time in on my cello</li>
	<li>Get some consistent quality time in on my Chinese language (中文) practice</li>
	<li>Lots of planning to do for next year: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Class schedule</span>, daily schedule, fitness/health/workout, meal planning, relationships, spiritual, reading, etcetera.</li>
	<li>I also plan to get back on the <a href="http://religiouspolitic.com/">Religious Politic</a> blog</li>
	<li>Spend some quality time with William, maybe do a little jam session</li>
	<li>Head out to Colorado to visit some friends</li>
</ul>
Some of this stuff is already pretty much done, thankfully.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Readers, I beg your attention for one moment, while I soliloquize loquacious on this finest of topics.

For has their ever been a more apt sign of manliness than this hairy friend? A man may be brawny and wise, but without these gifts of nature a man may still only be seen as a boy. These filaments grown on ones face are the very strings that become figurative ropes, pulling a boy from his last vestiges of immaturity and forcing him into the world of the adult.

The beard has, it could be said, numberless uses, but there are a few which stand the test of time, and these few which all men do enjoy. For what bearded man has not enjoyed the subtle pleasure of gently pulling at his hairs while thinking upon some difficult subject? Or what man with a curled mustache has not spent total countless hours twirling those finely crafted gifts of nature?

And what greater natural respite from the bitter gale of cold winter winds has a man known than a thick beard? If he were to consider his beard as paltry, let him but lay a razor to those same hairs which now protect him and the biting cold of winter will show him the folly of his ways.

But to me, my dear reader, I hold one enjoyment above all others.

As I spend time outside in the winter air, my breath alights on my beard, condensing and freezing to tiny droplets of ice. These crystals growing on my face remind me in a compelling way of my manhood, and of the Creators divine gift of the beard.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First, a short back-story:

At school I often go to the student union building to eat. It has a little Chinese restaurant, the couple who run the place are very friendly and know me by name.

"How are your studies?", they ask me. "Always busy!", I respond.

While I sit and eat I usually study, and when I study I don't usually listen to music. And so, while I sit and study, I find myself listening in on other people's conversations.

Now, I'll tell you what I hear:

Everyone wants to talk, but no one wants to listen.

As I sit and listen, a couple sits close by and this conversation goes on:
<blockquote>Person 1: "Today my teacher was so annoying, he just went on and on and on."

Person 2: "My bicycle has a flat tire, and so I had to walk today."

Person 1: "It was like this droning, it just kept going!"

Person 2: "I had to take a bus, and this guy smelled bad."</blockquote>
This is a made-up conversation, but it is a typical exchange, and I hear conversations like this very frequently. Neither person is listening to the other, neither one shows a concern for the other.

I used to write a lot, but the last few years I've become more frustrated with the amount of noise and the lack of listening, so I don't write as much because I don't want to be just another noise. Even now I struggle, trying to decide if this is worth telling you.
<blockquote>Listening to other people is an art.</blockquote>
People say that all the time, and I don't want to say it's not true, but I'm going to anyway: It's not really true.

At least, it's not a really helpful statement.

Let me tell you what I think, please take this to heart: Listening is about caring.

Placing another persons cares above your own.

Caring about another person above your own cares and concerns.

Sometimes I want to interrupt these people who are talking-but-not-listening and ask them whether they really care about the other person.

I don't think they do, at least not in a meaningful way, and it makes me sad.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am high above the houses, peering across my neighborhood at the people small enough to be G.I. Joe toys. Up here the roofs look like ant hills, and the cars are small enough that I even wave my hand, trying to grab them. And my polished green bicycle rests against the bottom trunk, my ladder to reach the top.

Things are different now, I am bigger, older. The only branches I climb are mathematical: Directed acyclic graphs and syntax trees. So I decided to go back and see what the world looks like from above.

Climbing a tree is no easy task - I immediately catch my shirt on some twigs and scrape my arms on the rough bark, continuing upward I almost run into a wasp nest but manage to move around it. As I reach up, my hand slips into a small puddle and disturbs a cloud of mosquitoes. Now I am planting my face right into a spider web, and now a small cavalry of ants is crawling over my back as I wonder what could have been so worth fighting for at the top of this tree.

Almost to the top, I notice a few nests, a robin (with eggs!) and a gargantuan squirrel nest look precariously balanced. I notice some carvings on the branches from a red-headed woodpecker, some moss still manages to cling and even some small grassy weed has made its way up here. Over in one of the branches, the tree holds a bit of kite string from ages ago, reminding me of power lines and blustery afternoons in a crowded city. And here I begin to hear the familiar grumblings of an old elm, his creaking words barely perceptible as he speaks of some old riddle or tells a tale of bright streaks of lightning and racing winds.

And suddenly I am at the top and I feel a rush, the first cheeky gust of wind trying to push me off. But I settle down into an old crevice, supported by the branches, twisting and turning with the motion of the tree. And I look down at the roofs that seem as small as ant hills, and the people like toys. And then I notice the snail just below me, who tortuously climbed his way up here. This elm becomes a safe haven, for beetles and ants and mosquito and birds and even for one person.

Perhaps this is the allure of this high perch, up here where I forget about pressing engagements and quadratic formulas and schedules. Up here the tree welcomes me with open branches and gently flowing leaves. The wind is running down my t-shirt leaving ripples to weave strange patterns as the sun works its way through the leaves and traces its way across my chest, darts onto my face and lazily walks back down my arm before disappearing again.

Perhaps soon I will climb back down, through the spider web and the wasps and mosquitoes, but right now I will stay just one more minute and let the sun dance one last time.]]></content:encoded>

	<li><a href="http://db.tt/nIbK3rL">Dropbox</a>:  A file backup program, one of the best. It's free for a couple GBs, but  I like it so much I pay for it. If I could convince you to use any one  of these programs on this list, this would be it. Seriously.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/">Adobe Flash Player</a>: A necessary evil, but seriously, it's not <em>that</em> bad...</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>:  The absolute best for zip files, and for any other compression method  as well. You can even take apart exe and docx files as well.</li>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great list, Toby. Here are a few programs I use on Windows that I think might be helpful to you:

InfraRecorder: An open-source CD/DVD burner. You can burn almost anything with it. It even has a cool Aero burning effect that you can configure to run when you're burning a CD or DVD http://www.infrarecorder.org .

GIMP for Windows: yes, the same GIMP that you use on Linux is also available on Windows. http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimp-win/files/GIMP%20%2B%20GTK%2B%20%28stable%20release%29/GIMP%202.8.0/

SpeedCrunch: An open-source calculator that beats the Windows calculator by a light-year. It has a command-style way of entering calculations. It also has a ton of functions. http://www.speedcrunch.org

Inkscape: THE vector-graphics drawing tool. Also on Linux. http://www.inkscape.org

Cygwin: A Linux system for Windows. It's sort of like a virtual machine but not quite. It runs as a native Windows app, and can be faster than a Linux virtual machine if you don't have hardware virtualization. It has all of the regular tools that you can use on a Linux system like grep, make, etc. It even has an X server that you can easily use with PuTTY for X11 SSH forwarding (though it also has the regular Linux SSH client).

Smart Defrag: A really good defragging tool. It can even be configured to defrag the pagefile and some other Windows system files at boot. http://www.iobit.com/iobitsmartdefrag.html

Wise Registry Cleaner: A tool that you can use to clean up your registry from junk. It can also defrag your registry, which can tremendously speed-up a slow Windows computer (though, compared to Linux, it will still be a little sluggish). http://wisecleaner.com/wiseregistrycleanerfree.html

ElectricSheep: This probably isn't so much useful as it is interesting and fun. It is a screensaver that consists of all sorts of interesting combinations of animated colored patterns. It is a distributed-computing project. A main server comes up with random algorithms for creating new patterns, and it hands a portion of the algorithm to all computers using the screensaver and connected to the Internet. It has thus created a internet-wide pool of these patterns of which your computer downloads downloads a small set and uses that set of patterns as a screensaver. http://www.electricsheep.org]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Thesis:</strong> Modern music is dead.

<strong>Evidence:</strong> Lyrical depth is limited to "Partyin', partyin' (Yeah), Fun, fun, fun, fun, Lookin' forward to the weekend."
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0">Rebecca Black: Friday</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioOEBdIgQ5g">Abby Victor: Crush on You</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xHfRUW99aI">Alana Lee: Butterflies</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsiRwvGQn_M">Britt Rutter: Without Your Love</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fivcyoJv_kc">Ariana Dvornik: Fly Away</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oVnBGRIZSQ">CJ Fam: Ordinary Pop Star</a></li>
</ul>
Some of you may argue that I am really just linking to "singers" that are products of the <a href="http://arkmusicfactory.com/">ARK Factory</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARK_Music_Factory">Wikipedia</a>), an establishment that is comparable to the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_poem">Song Poem</a>" days of music. You may hold these types of musicians as the minority in modern music, so I will present more evidence:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bESGLojNYSo">Stefani Germanotta: Poker Face</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKxodgpyGec">Cee Lo Green: F**k You</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OehxXNCYvTM">Katy Perry and Kanye West: E.T.</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR6iYWJxHqs">Bruno Mars: Grenade</a></li>
</ul>
And yes, I am basically just running down the Billboard top 100 chart.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Listening to Phoenix</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been listening to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix/e/B000AP74G8/">Phoenix</a>" lately, a techno-ish sort of music that is easy to listen to. In one of the songs he asks "do you remember when 21 years was old", which I thought was an interesting question.

So I asked it on Facebook. To my friends.

Many replies later, I got to wondering: What was I doing when I was 21? It was a few years ago, but thankfully, I was able to peruse my journals and remember.

When I was 21 I was in love with a girl. Cowardice and immaturity were (are?) my strong suits, so here I am. Alone.

And when I thought of that relationship, I got stuck in thought: Why do women say men are "afraid of commitment"?

One time I was working with an older lady who had been divorced, and she asked me that. "Why are men so afraid to commit?" It took me a while to think of what she said, but I realized: Men aren't afraid of commitment, but rather of rejection and failure.

Freud often took his personal analysis and extrapolated it to say that everyone felt just like he did. I guess I'm going to be guilty of the same thing, but I'm going to say it anyway: Men lower their goals because they don't want to fail at meeting those self-imposed goals.

It's silly, in a way, but basically we think "I'll never reach goal A, so I'll set my goal lower to make sure I achieve it." If a man lowers this goal to "nothing in particular", they'll be the lazy couch sitters that this culture is so familiar with.

And men also don't want to be rejected. I have a hard time deciding if this is pure pride, or a different topic, but I lean toward the latter.

I think I didn't want to commit to that relationship because of fear of failing at developing a real and lasting relationship.

I'm still learning, I guess.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Things on my heart</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a lot on my heart tonight: I've finally reached a point where I can see the end of school and I have a reasonably good job mostly lined up for when I'm done, so I've been thinking of how the next "stage of life" will be starting shortly. Here is what I've been thinking about mostly:

Some people say men are afraid of relationships, afraid of commitments. One lady told me that, but at the time I didn't realize that what I was afraid of was being vulnerable. It's not the decisiveness of a commitment that I was afraid of, it was the vulnerability that the commitment required.

When I was younger I quit my job because I wanted to know what it would be like to have all the time I wanted to finally read books. (I haven't always been a planner, as you can tell.) Another time I left a job that would have turned into me owning a restaurant, so I could volunteer for a couple years at some camp. Then when I left the camp, only a few years ago, I abandoned a solid career to go to school and try to get into an industry I knew nothing about.

I never wanted to make a serious commitment to a job or a place or even, sadly, to friends.

But over the past three or four years I have been having a change of heart. A change of focus. I guess that's part of "growing up", that now I am making plans for a hundred years from now. My carefree spirit has changed quite a bit. Now I have commitments.

I'm not complaining: I have been blessed with an opportunity that I would never have dreamed possible, and blessed with many good close friends. I guess I'm just getting impatient to be done with school so I can move onto what I can see waiting right in front of me.

Many years ago a friend told me what love is, but I forgot what was said--at the time it was very meaningful to me, but now I don't think it would satisfy.

These days I think love is more about being vulnerable to someone. Caring about someone enough to drop the veil that guards your face when you normally talk to people. Dropping the veil because it makes it harder to see the other person.

I guess what I really want is to be vulnerable again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Way of Children</title>
		<link>http://davistobias.com/2011/10/25/the-way-of-children/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was a child, I acted as a child. I still do, actually. But as I grow older, I put away childish things.

Years ago I read a book that changed my thinking, and greatly shaped several years of my life. The book was a story about a man who meets a child, and the child changes the mans life. The child reminds the man of the innocence of youth, and how as adults we grow out of that innocence and become adults.

Become more jaded.

More cynical of life.

As we get older we realize that people don't always mean what they say, and even our friends will lie to us. We start to notice that there are a lot of people who don't care about us, and they'll deceive us to make a few more dollars, and they'll hurt us inside, where we thought we could be safe.

There comes a point in our lives that we realize there are things that can't be deflected by our pillow forts and can't be stopped by a blanket. Someone says something that hurts us so deep, and even the kisses of someone we love cannot drive away the pain and the sorrow, and that pain and sorrow we will have to carry alone for the rest of our lives.

When I was a child, I thought friends would never hurt their friends. When I was a child, my best friend told her friends that I was a nobody. That's when I first realized that people could hurt other people on purpose. That a person can say they are a friend, but still hurt you.

Many times people will say wistfully that they wish they could have the innocence of youth, that they could be free from the cares and worry of life. To be free of the hurry and bustle of life. To have the intense joy of something as simple as someone giving you an ice cream cone.
<blockquote><em>When I was a child, I acted as a child.</em></blockquote>
I hurt people deeply, and I continued doing it because the end result was enjoyable for me. I didn't understand that I could hurt someone so deeply, and affect their life so negatively, and even though I knew the thing that I did was wrong, I did it anyway. This is the way of a child.

In the innocence children, there is pain much deeper. Where there is no worry, there is no care for others. As a child, love is only selfishness.

The spring blossom of youth soon fades, but not to be jaded by the harshness of life. The innocence of youth is lost to the realization that we humans are cruel and mean. We hurt each other, and we usually do it on purpose. But it is not enough just to see that other people hurt you. This does not make you an adult.
<blockquote><em>As I grow older, I put away childish things.</em></blockquote>
Wanting to return to the innocence of childhood is to cause others pain. As children we were ignorant of the pain we caused others, and we were ignorant of how our actions would hurt people. But as we grow older, we put away the selfishness of childish things.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I did not go to culinary school. In fact, it's my personal opinion that culinary school is mostly a waste of time (more on that later). Instead I worked for several years as a lower chef, and passively gained experience until I moved up the proverbial ladder.

Working in food service was fun but tiring, as a chef you'll always be on your feet. Be prepared to have a tired back for quite some time, until the muscles get conditioned to the 12 hour standing up routine. The enjoyable part of food service to me was twofold:

1) You get to make things! Depending on what you specialize in and where you work, you get to make more or less interesting things. For example, if you work as a salad chef on a buffet line, you probably won't get to make those cool plates and awesome cakes, but you can add a little personal flair by carving flowers and things out of tomatoes and radishes.

2) You get to spend time with people, in a very unique environment. It's sometimes high stress, but a lot of "boring" time spent together, talking about any old thing. Don't let this frighten you if you aren't really a people person, you can also be pretty quiet if you want, but after you spend some time in the kitchen you'll open up. It really is a blast.

The correlations are true:

1) If you don't enjoy making simple creative things, food service probably won't be something you enjoy.

2) If you work somewhere with un-friendly people, you will get burnt out really quickly.

Anyway ... I loved making food (still do, actually), and I loved running the kitchen even more. I loved it enough to start putting a business plan together to start my own restaurant.

However, the one issue with food service is that it takes a lot of time, and is higher stress than an office job. From what I can tell, through experience and visiting other kitchens, this is true from the lowly fast-food shop to the high dollar restaurant extraordinaire. Food service is always a hurry-hurry-hurry, wait-wait-wait kind of job, so it's not always high stress, but the peaks of stress can be pretty high sometimes.

In the end, I realized I could make a career using the intellect God has blessed me with, and realized I would rather do that than continue down the path I was on.

I suppose it was part of my "growing up" years, because I also realized I had gotten into food service passively. What I mean is that I didn't actively pursue personal education of food stuffs, of how to run restaurants, but I had taken this career path because it was easier.

And that's another thing: Food service doesn't really give you much money per hour, so it's really hard to justify spending 2-4 years at culinary school in the hope that you get a better job. Unless you are prepared to really go at it, culinary school is a high cost, low return investment.

Not that it wouldn't be fun, because I'm pretty sure it would be, but you'd better count your fun-per-dollar and see if it's worth it. I'd say 90% of the time it's not.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every day she waits,
that queen of a desolate kingdom.
Desert filled with sand
of a thousand years,
no flower blooms there anymore.

Stone walls, built high,
and years pass by
turning walls into fields of sand,
empty and forgotten.

As the sun sets on her desert
she cannot remember the walls,
but beyond them now
is only emptiness.

Queen, high above the ground,
she does not notice others
because there is only one.
Only one man is her rose,
and that rose is a king.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>[Every year, around my birthday, I reflect on who I am, where I've come from, and where I'm going, and then I pour out my heart in this blog. This year is no different.]</em>

Can you remember when you were six? Some people can, especially if they are still six, but my memory slips in and out and I can only remember bits and phrases. One piece goes like this:

My fathers friend, who was also my friend, died when I was rather young, and I remember going to the funeral. This man was a friend to many, and he brought happiness into many people's lives, so there were many people there, and lots of them were crying.

I didn't cry then.

As far back as my memory goes, I don't recall ever being a person who cries easily. I felt pain, I was incredibly sad many times, but I've always been good at putting away my sadness, hiding my sorrow behind a stone wall. A barricade to keep people out.

<em>"Good fences make good neighbors"</em>

Only a short number of years ago, I met someone who I thought for sure I would marry <em>"a promise in time, shadows of memories..."</em> When that relationship didn't work out, I was overcome with grief, but I did not cry much. I was silent for days, my heart was heavy in me while a called out to God, <em>"save me or I perish"</em>, but I did not weep.

Do you remember when you were six? Do you remember what made you cry then?

When I was younger, probably ten or twelve, I was learning math (Algebra) and it was so difficult that it made me cry. But even at that age I could see the golden treasure behind the veil, and I persevered, and now (years later) I'm wrapping up a degree in engineering.

But I didn't want to talk about "perseverance", I wanted to say that I wasn't six then, I was much older.
<blockquote><span>"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span>" (Mark 10:14)</blockquote>
Why does Jesus say this, that the kingdom of God "belongs to such as these"?

When I was six years old, I hardly knew how to read, if I recall correctly. The world was becoming a strange and dark place to me, I was becoming aware of what pain was, of why people cry, of right and wrong, of love, and of death.

A child hears everything you say, and is thinking about it more than you realize. Parents know this when the thing they said several days ago comes out of the mouth of their five year old, sometimes with comedic results.

I recently watched a movie where a young child is told that the sun is going to get bigger and bigger, eventually burning up the earth and the entire solar system, and it didn't matter to the child that it would be billions of years down the road. What mattered is that, quite suddenly, the child realized a bigger truth, that everything and everyone around you will someday die.

Probably by now you are wondering what this is all about, because it sure seems like I'm going somewhere. And you are right, but I don't think I can summarize in a nice simple paragraph.

You see, some things can't be summarized into bumper-sticker slogans, or nice paragraph summaries. Some things in life are so deep, and so meaningful that to even try to put it in words seems to trivialize the very thing you are trying to say. But I will try to say it here:

The love of God is greater than tongue or pen can tell. If I were to fill the ocean with ink, and write all that ink onto paper, describing the love of God, I would drain the ocean dry and still be on the first chapter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here it is, Christmas day, and I've got a few thoughts running through my head, keeping me from sleep.</p><p>Next week is my last week at the intern job I've had over the summer/fall, and a week after that I'll be starting up another semester of school. Only two semesters left... I had so many plans for this summer, and almost none of them happened.</p><p>Today I realized more concretely, while planning the moving-back-to-school, that I was almost done here, and starting school will once again cut me off from my friends here. And as I thought more on this, I felt more and more alone. I'll be living in an apartment with a friend, and I'll still see most of these friends about the same amount, but during the semester I always feel so cut off and distanced. Probably because of the distance.</p><p>But general friendships aren't why I'm still awake at 2am, it's a very specific relationship.</p><p>And a real fear that I'll lose the friendship by the cold forces of time and distance.</p><p>But when I say "lose", I don't mean how it's normally meant. I mean that, by time and distance, and the inevitable changes about to occur in some of my circles of friends, that the relationship will be... Well, I guess maybe "lost" is the best word.</p><p>Set aside and forgotten.</p><p>Displaced with other interests.</p><p>"It's a sad thing to lose a friend", he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes waiting is forever,
holding on to a fleeting promise
in one moment is beaten and blown away.
Every day a lifetime of memories
and hopes and dreams
not quite a handle to grab on to,
but maybe enough to fill me with desire
of something a little more tangible.
These minutes feel like lifetimes,
and this year looms ahead
an unending chasm.
But soon it is over and I'll emerge
again to survey my surroundings
perhaps a familiar marker
something set aside but remembered
and treasured.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my dreams I saw a bright and terrible light descend from heaven,  and the earth was split open and I fell through the crust of the earth, dying the death of a thousand other men before me. As I fell, father down into the abyss, I heard the tortured cries of the lost, warning of the wrath to come.

And while I fell I looked down and the hole into which I plunged opened below me into a roaring furnace, and I knew my fate and my judgment was near. Stricken with terror, my heightened senses felt the leaping flames as I approached, billows of heat swept past me and seared me in agonizing pain.

I awoke that night, cold and pale. A great pain in my chest from a heart that had stopped beating.

And I, that night so many years ago, with a life so nearly snatched away, realized my mortality quite plainly, and saw that this was what awaited me. Death was standing at my door, and the lock was undone.

This was many years ago, and although the realization of my own mortality has stayed with me, yet here I am, wasting the time away with trinkets and playthings. Is this what God saved me for? I have a purpose and a reason for living, my life was redeemed for a price, yet I carry on with my fleshly desires. Oh God, help me to behave as a true bondservant!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>When I run I feel His pleasure, thoughts on &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although the film is, at the time of this writing, nearly thirty-one years old, and although I have heard of the story many times before, it was only today that I watched the movie "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/">Chariots of Fire</a>". I'll just assume you already know the story, and if you don't you can read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_Fire">Wikipedia article</a> and then meet me back here.

Contrary to my expectations I found the movie to be quite enjoyable, and the story itself reasonably well produced. The movie itself has been hyped up quite a bit, so I was expecting to be let down because of "Oh it's the best thing ever" never seems to live up to the hype, but it should really be a classic on everyone's shelf.

The part that I want to point out is the excellent film directing at the final race, where Liddell is running a longer distance than he originally trained for. When he starts running, the film director plays back this quote from earlier in the movie:
<blockquote>"I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel His pleasure."

Eric Liddell</blockquote>
There are two points of character development that I want to note. The first is the setting of this quote when it is first said by Liddel. He and his sister, Jennie, are in the midst of a sort of family dispute: His sister is worried that he is becoming obsessed with running, and he is losing track of what matters. He explains his intentions, to run in the Olympics and return to his mission field in China, but Jennie does not understand so he says the above quote in an attempt to explain himself.

The other character development point is that of Harold Abrahams, the second main character. Toward the end of the movie, Abrahams confesses that his entire existence is in question if he cannot win the race, saying "with 10 lonely seconds to justify my whole existence". This is really shown well at the end of his final race, right before crossing the finish line Abrahams face shows true desperation. It is the face of a man driven to the edges of madness, driven by despair.

Here is a stark contrast created by the director: One man runs out of desperation, and the other runs for pleasure. Ultimately both of them win, but I want to draw your attention to <em>how</em> they won.

In Liddell's final race, the quote I mentioned earlier is played back, and the timing is absolutely flawless. As Liddell leaves the starting line, his face is one of steeled determination, the dialogue begins. "<em>I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast.</em>" As these last words are spoken, Liddel's face begins to change and the steeled determination gives way to a slight enjoyment. "<em>And when I run</em>", the dialogue continues. It is at this moment that Liddel's entire demeanor changes. His face bursts into a brilliant smile of ecstasy, and his entire body seems caught up in the moment. The dialogue finishes, "<em>I feel His pleasure</em>". This scene alone is worth (and requires) the entire buildup of the movie.

To really drive home this point, during Liddell's run, among the typical cut scenes of the fans, family, and friends, there is a cut to Abrahams who is looking on with what is certainly one of the saddest expressions he has made. It is as though, after only earlier confessing that he runs primarily out of desperation, he suddenly saw and realized that Liddell ran for the pure joy of it. That what Liddell had was something he had never once felt.

Here is my takeaway, the very blunt and high-handed "moral of the story": Do you know what, like Liddell, lets you feel God's pleasure? I don't, and this movie really struck a nerve there, hopefully you can be motivated as well.
<blockquote>"You can praise God by peeling a spud if you peel it to perfection."

Reverend. J.D. Liddell</blockquote>
P.S. If you haven't seen the movie in some time, or have never seen it, I recommend watching it and particularly watching Liddell and Abrahams' last races. The facial expressions of the actors, and the directing of the timing are incredible.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, in a private group I am in, this article was posted: <a href="m.omaha.com/om/db_275159/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=C4oShaMC&amp;full=true#display">Will Paul's backers rally behind Romney?</a> While the article is the usual political type, attempting to rally people to a cause, I found this line interesting:
<blockquote>"While Paul's following may be a blip on the national political radar, his supporters bring effective organization, dedicated volunteers and potential donors to the table, and every vote is crucial in close swing states - and Iowa is one."</blockquote>
As a supporter of the Liberty movement, and one who became active and concerned about politics because of the vision Ron Paul cast, I think that if "every vote is crucial" maybe they shouldn't have worked so hard to disenfranchise the Paul voters during the nomination race and at the convention. Whatever my choice ends up being this fall, there is a large weight of a grudge that I carry against the GOP for their treatment of Paul during the race, and their reaction now after the fact.

Even a simple apology from the Romney/GOP people would go a long way to smooth things over. "Sorry our people were such big jerks to you guys during the campaign." None of this "sorry, but" business either. Maybe something like "Sorry we broke the rules so many times and did so many questionably legal things."

I'm a Christian man, and I have used this verse in personal and business relationships many times: "A gentle answer turns away wrath". Right now the GOP has my wrath, and after what I have experienced and read I believe it is justly placed. And even though I wouldn't believe them in the slightest, a "soft answer" from the GOP would help cool my anger.

There's another verse I believe is important, especially now: "Wise as serpents, innocent as doves". We strike where our agility and speed will give us great returns, but don't become embittered by the evils of the world around us. You and I can make a change, but that change must start with those around us.

Who is your county sheriff? Who is on your city council? Are you involved in your neighborhood? I heard a quote long ago from someone I don't know who, that went something like this: "How can you expect the national government to be limited when you can't even get your local city government to limit their budget?"

The raging inferno starts with a small ember.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A retelling of an ancient story.</em>

A frog one morning was standing by the side of a stream, when a scorpion approached him, requesting a ride across the water.

By Tobias Davis"]<a href="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/09/2012-09-22_2238_1024x701_cropped.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1340" src="http://davistobias.com/files/2012/09/2012-09-22_2238_1024x701_cropped-300x205.png" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></a>[/caption]

"Sir Frog, may I request your benevolence in assisting me to cross these rapidly moving waters? I cannot swim, and would surely drown if I attempted passage on my own, but if I rode upon your back I could traverse this stream safely."

The frog was feeling especially charitable, but knew that the scorpion could quite easily kill him.

"Sir Scorpion, while I may be able to carry you across, you may perhaps be overcome with some dark thought, and sting me with your powerful venom so that I die! Surely I cannot aid you in your request."

"Ah, but Sir Frog, as I am unable to swim at all, if I were to sting you I would be unable to rescue myself from these swiftly flowing waters, and I would surely perish as well!"

The frog, being convinced by the scorpion's words and feeling particularly charitable, gave heed to the scorpion's request, and proceeded to carry him across the stream.

But near the middle of the stream, the scorpion quite purposefully stung the frog!

As the frog struggled against the powers of the poisonous venom, he gasped, "Ah, Scorpion, you have deceived me! Now we will both perish in these waters!"

The scorpion, struggled to stay afloat, but being wholly unable to do so replied with his final breath, "It is my very nature to kill!"]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Economics FAQ: How much do I deserve?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a question that comes up frequently, and it is this:
<blockquote>If a person works hard to do a thing, don't they deserve compensation for their labor?</blockquote>
The short but difficult answer is this: No.

The longer answer is this: Your labor is worth exactly as much as another person is willing to pay for it.

The even longer answer is this:

The only time that a person *deserves* compensation for their labor is when they have been contracted to do that labor. For example, I am compensated bi-weekly for my labor in producing code for the company I work for. The company has contracted me to work for them in compensation for some dollars for every hour of work.

My brother may go mow a lawn in two hours and make 20$. How much does he deserve to make? 10$? 10000$? He may *desire* to make a million dollars, but he *deserves* whatever compensation he has willingly contracted to receive.

A friend of mine decides to paint a beautiful painting one day, how much does this friend deserve? It is the same as if I spent two weeks working on a program for myself. My friend and myself both *deserve* zero dollars. This is because we did not contract with anyone for an agreed compensation, so no person is obliged to pay either of us any amount whatsoever. Perhaps someone agrees to buy my friends painting for 100$, and the program I spent a week on turns out to be useless. Neither of us deserved either amount of compensation, because neither of us contracted with another party for compensation.

The lazy solution is to never make or design or write anything unless you have a contract with someone to have them pay you an amount that you both agree on.

The solution most people take is to produce a thing and make a guess at what people will be willing to pay for it. My brother and I are working on a keyboard that we think people will pay about 200-300$ for. My friend is making a painting and hopes to sell it for 100$. In both cases we are taking a risk, because we do not know if anyone will buy the thing we are producing. If my friend cannot sell their painting, they have a financial loss of the paint and canvas and the time they spent making the painting. If my brother and I cannot sell our keyboard we will have a financial loss of the electronic components and hardware and the time we spent making the keyboard.

In both cases of loss, however, neither of us *deserve* any compensation. We both freely made our things, and did so with the realization that we might not make any profit from it.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Now thats a thought or two.  If we got what we deserved we would be most unhappy.  Life surely is a risk and value is debatable.  None the less, when I bought the series, I agreed to their terms in exchange for the right to be able to study their goods that they put up.  I was willing to pay them what they wanted for it because for me it was worth the money.  For them, it probably still has risk involved because who knows how many people will buy their stuff in order to pay for their efforts.  Thus the element of risk again.  Its nice when you can find a need and fill it with something of yours that will make a profit on both sides.]]></wp:comment_content>
