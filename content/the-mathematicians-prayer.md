The Lord is my fundamental theorem, I shall freely integrate.  
He makes me to calculate only simple field functions,  
He giveth me simple polynomials,  
He guides me through easily parameterized paths, for His names sake.  
Even though I differentiate at the global minimum of life's functions,  
I will fear no undefined points, For Thou art with me.  
Thy axioms and Thy theorems, they comfort me.  
Thou dost grant me solutions to unsolved complex functions in the presence of my enemies.  
Surely the derivative of Your blessings is always positive,  
to the n<sup>th</sup> day of my life,  
and my vector field will point to Your origin while `t` approaches infinity.
