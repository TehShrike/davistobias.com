title: Economics FAQ: How much do I deserve?
update: 2013-01-07

There is a question that comes up frequently, and it is this:

> If a person works hard to do a thing, donâ€™t they deserve
> compensation for their labor?

The short but difficult answer is this: No.

The longer answer is this: Your labor is worth exactly as much
as another person is willing to pay for it.

The even longer answer is this:

The only time that a person *deserves* compensation for their
labor is when they have been contracted to do that labor. For
example, I am compensated bi-weekly for my labor in producing
code for the company I work for. The company has contracted me
to work for them in compensation for some dollars for every hour
of work.

My brother may go mow a lawn in two hours and make 20$. How much
does he deserve to make? 10$? 10000$? He may *desire* to make a
million dollars, but he *deserves* whatever compensation he has
willingly contracted to receive.

A friend of mine decides to paint a beautiful painting one day,
how much does this friend deserve? It is the same as if I spent
two weeks working on a program for myself. My friend and myself
both *deserve* zero dollars. This is because we did not contract
with anyone for an agreed compensation, so no person is obliged
to pay either of us any amount whatsoever. Perhaps someone agrees
to buy my friends painting for 100$, and the program I spent a
week on turns out to be useless.

Neither of us deserved either amount of compensation, because
neither of us contracted with another party for compensation.

The lazy solution is to never make or design or write anything
unless you have a contract with someone to have them pay you
an amount that you both agree on.

The solution most people take is to produce a thing and make
a guess at what people will be willing to pay for it. My brother
and I are working on a keyboard that we think people will pay
about 200-300$ for. My friend is making a painting and hopes
to sell it for 100$. In both cases we are taking a risk, because
we do not know if anyone will buy the thing we are producing.

If my friend cannot sell their painting, they have a financial
loss of the paint and canvas and the time they spent making
the painting. If my brother and I cannot sell our keyboard we
will have a financial loss of the electronic components and
hardware and the time we spent making the keyboard.

In both cases of loss, however, neither of us *deserve* any
compensation. We both freely made our things, and did so with
the realization that we might not make any profit from it.
