title: A man, lonely, on a bridge.

These night pathways shine back the pale lights with an unseemly sheen,  
the empty streets seem a fragile reflection  
of my own emptiness.  

A moonless night is testimony to the man I once was.  
The shadow remains, but only from  
the cold and lifeless halogen bulbs.  

And yet, as I stand  
(melancholy) looking down  
from this wind swept bridge to the road below,  
I am interrupted by a gleaming light  
and a howling sound.  

As wind sweeps this chilled frame a voice comes from behind:  
My soliloquy is interrupted  
by a police officer who wonders  
why I am talking to my empty cup of malted ice cream.
