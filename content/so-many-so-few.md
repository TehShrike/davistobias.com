title: So many, so few.

First, a short back-story:

At school I often go to the student union building to eat. It has a little
Chinese restaurant, the couple who run the place are very friendly and
know me by name.

<q>How are your studies?</q>, they ask me. <q>Always busy!</q>, I respond.

While I sit and eat I usually study, and when I study I don't usually
listen to music. And so, while I sit and study, I find myself listening
in on other people's conversations.

Now, I'll tell you what I hear:

Everyone wants to talk, but no one wants to listen.

As I sit and listen, a couple sits close by and this conversation goes on:

> Person 1: <q>Today my teacher was so annoying, he just went on and on and on.</q>
>
> Person 2: <q>My bicycle has a flat tire, and so I had to walk today.</q> 
> 
> Person 1: <q>It was like this droning, it just kept going!</q>
> 
> Person 2: <q>I had to take a bus, and this guy smelled bad.</q>

This is a made-up conversation, but it is a typical exchange, and I hear
conversations like this very frequently. Neither person is listening to
the other, neither one shows a concern for the other.

I used to write a lot, but the last few years I've become more frustrated
with the amount of noise and the lack of listening, so I don't write as
much because I don't want to be just another noise.

Even now I struggle, trying to decide if this is worth telling you:

> Listening to other people is an art.

People say that all the time, and I don't want to say it's not true, but
I'm going to anyway: *It's not really true.*

At least, it's not a really helpful statement.

Let me tell you what I think, please take this to heart: Listening is
about caring.

Placing another persons cares above your own.

Caring about another person above your own cares and concerns.

Sometimes I want to interrupt these people who are talking-but-not-listening
and ask them whether they really care about the other person.

I don't think they do, at least not in a meaningful way, and it makes me sad.
