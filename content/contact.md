title: Talk to me
updated: 2014-10-28


Here are some ways to get in touch:

1. I do not respond to most lines of communication very quickly.
2. This is because I prefer face-to-face communication.
3. Alternately, video chat. I do use Google Hangouts, if you can connect to me there.
4. Outside that, I prefer email for all internet communication, and
  you can email me at this address: `tobias@THIS DOMAIN.com`
5. If you use a Jabber/XMPP chat client, you can use the same address to chat with me.
6. Because I don't have a way to ensure that comments are not
  [YouTube awful](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-YouTube-comments-so-bad),
  I have elected to instead disable comments. If you have thoughts
  or critiques on a post, or if you would like to submit corrections,
  please see the [Github repo](https://github.com/saibotsivad/saibotsivad.github.io/)
  and create pull requests or new issues. I should respond pretty quickly there.
7. Please ask before sending physical mail. I have several physical mailing
  addresses online, but either one will probably get to me within a few months.

If you share a liking for good whiskey and deep conversation about
the things in life that matter, I'm sure we'd get along splendidly.
