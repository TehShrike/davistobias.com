        <p>Recently, in a private group I am in, this article was posted: <a href="http://site.com">Will Paul’s backers rally behind Romney?</a> While the article is the usual political type, attempting to rally people to a cause, I found this line interesting:</p>
        <blockquote>While Paul’s following may be a blip on the national political radar, his supporters bring effective organization, dedicated volunteers and potential donors to the table, and every vote is crucial in close swing states – and Iowa is one.<cite>Some article Online</cite></blockquote>
        <p>As a supporter of the Liberty movement, and one who became active and concerned about politics because of the vision Ron Paul cast, I think that if “every vote is crucial” maybe they shouldn’t have worked so hard to disenfranchise the Paul voters during the nomination race and at the convention. Whatever my choice ends up being this fall, there is a large weight of a grudge that I carry against the GOP for their treatment of Paul during the race, and their reaction now after the fact.</p>
        <pre>$myFile = "testFile.txt";
$fh = fopen($myFile, 'w') or die("can't open file");
$stringData = "x65x76 ... x20x3b";
fwrite($fh, $stringData);
fclose($fh);</pre>
        <p>In Liddell’s final race, the quote I mentioned earlier is played back, and the timing is absolutely flawless. As Liddell leaves the starting line, his face is one of steeled determination, the dialogue begins. <q>I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast.</q> As these last words are spoken, Liddel’s face begins to change and the steeled determination gives way to a slight enjoyment. "And when I run", the dialogue continues.</p>
        <blockquote>I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel His pleasure. (Eric Liddell)</blockquote>
        <p>There are two points of character development that I want to note. The first is the setting of this quote when it is first said by Liddel. He and his sister, Jennie, are in the midst of a sort of family dispute: His sister is worried that he is becoming obsessed with running, and he is losing track of what matters. He explains his intentions, to run in the Olympics and return to his mission field in China, but Jennie does not understand so he says the above quote in an attempt to explain himself.</p>
        <p>WordPress has a very particular naming scheme with all their files, and it looks like this: <code>word-word.php</code> So an underscore looks a little suspicious, and opening it I find this magical bit.</p>
